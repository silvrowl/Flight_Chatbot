It was very unclear that I wasn\\'t supposed to use the numbers from the first 4 clues and they were actually pointing to letters on other bottles.  It would have been more obvious as a chemist if I solved for the number 8 that is was oxygen.  Given the bottles had meaningless numbers it was not clear my math solutions pointed to other bottles because it didn\\'t match periodic table in my head.,\"Make it so last puzzle with grease pen map isn\\'t such a bottleneck.  We found all locations in the briefcase and we only had 1 pencil.  So 6 people have to watch 1 person try to neatly, quickly, write each location down by its second name.  We lost the game because it took too long to transfer the names, not because we didn\\'t know what to do.  The task was tedious and required being neat to ensure we didn\\'t mess up the symbol that connecting the map pieces would create.  Please give more pens and a bigger map if I\\'m expected to write a secondary name for every location.

But some of it actually happened as told; some of it is lost; or mixed up with our personal identity myth, forever. We do remember what we think matters to us, now. This is how I remember it, now, today. I suppose that makes us all, at least to some degree, poseurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Canadian Prairies the successors of original settler families let old barns and houses weather and collapse on their own, to keep the memories of their ancestors alive. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotem Pole monuments, created by First Nations people of the Pacific Northwest commemorate ancestry, histories and events. The poles are also allowed to decay naturally to preserve local heros and history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis autobiography was written to preserve a history for the use of my children. I have tried to sort out my own innocence from the years when other people made my decisions for me, especially during the war years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe who was living is now dead,   \\r\\nWe who were living are now dying ---  \\r\\nWith a little patience \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\t--- T. S. Eliot, The Waste Land\\r\\n\\r\\nEliot wrote poems to satisfy both emotion and intellect, while making words hang parsimoniously together. Without poetry, we live partially, not making a full effort to appreciate what really lay about us in the past. I have always envied Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talent. He was not cynical, as the above might imply. He had a great respect for the spiritual, as do I. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy own hope is to approach some degree of transcendency, as in  Buddhist/Hindu meditation. Like it or not, this moment is all we have to work with. Mindfulness, the heart of Buddhist meditation, involves reaching awareness and understanding of our own rationality and how it influences our perceptions and our actions, now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAchieving personal transcendency is of course selfish, but the pilgrimage always promises to be rewarding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrdinary men hate solitude.\\r\\nBut a Master makes use of it,\\r\\nTo be one with the universe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\t--- Lao-Tzu, Tao-te-Ching.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein was young, especially during the war years, he was totally dependent on Romulus, his father. To Rein, at first, it was all an adventure, no worries. Then came years of learning how to manage on his own. Then came a rush to achieve, to catch up to others around him. Finally came the drive to achieve, to see how far he could reach. There was no time to get a personal perspective, especially about a father who was indeed his hero and his savior.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have written this Lifeline, primarily, as a personal investigation, for myself. To explain to myself how I have been fortunate enough to have survived to the age of 79 Plus. It has been a lucky, wonderful, awesome, journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will begin with a selective preamble of my historical past, and provide a cultural context, as to what I remember and have been told as happening. I start with ancient history, because I believe it is a part of who we have become. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonians have always been ancestor worshippers and of the nature they live in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man is an Island, entire to itself;\\r\\nEvery man is a piece of a continent.\\r\\nNever send to know for whom the bell tolls;\\r\\nFor it always tolls for thee.\\r\\n\\t--- John Donne, Meditation XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nAN OVERVIEW OF ESTONIAN CULTURAL HISTORY\\r\\n\\r\\nCollective memories and heroic stories have been retold to us and need to be retold to our children to live on. Reverence for tradition puts us in touch with the wisdom of our past. We are all a part of communities of memory that raise us above the mere accidental travelers of today. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonians are one of the longest settled European peoples, whose forebears, known as the \"comb pottery\" people, lived on the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea over 5,000 years ago. Like other early agricultural societies, Estonians were organized into economically self-sufficient, male-dominated clans with few differences in wealth or social power. By the early Middle Ages most Estonians were small landholders, with farmsteads primarily organized by village. Estonian government remained decentralized, with local political and administrative subdivisions emerging only during the first century A.D. By then, Estonia had a population of over 150,000 people and remained the last corner of medieval Europe to be Christianized.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, Estonians, have survived many conquests, including the recent attempt of 51 years of intense Russification. But we have held on to our distinct culture and language. By singing of our cultural reality, by proudly telling stories of our past, to ourselves and especially to our children, we ensured that Estonian culture will last for at least another ten thousand years to come. It is our heritage and our duty to pass it on to some 1,100,000 Estonians still left in the world. Such a cultural history enriches us, as Canadian citizens, and adds to the history of those who come after us. It helps to define \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho am I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I believe that by my heritage, I am an Estonian /Livonian /Viking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often believed, by non-Estonians, that Estonia, as a free independent country, has a short, approximately 22 year history (1918 to 1940). This is, of course, not true. Estonians were free and independent until the thirteenth century, when Teutonic crusaders quashed our ancient liberty and imposed a \\'dark age\\' of serfdom. During this dark age of serfdom, that lasted seven hundred years, under German Barons, Estonians never lost their vision. They often fought overwhelmingly large neighbour/oppressors and gained notable victories over them, to survive as a reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman settlement on the Estonian land mass became possible, they say, 11,000 to 13,000 years ago, when the ice from the last glacial era melted away. The oldest known settlement in Estonia \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Pulli Settlement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was located by archiologists on the banks of the River Parnu, near the town of Sindi, in southern Estonia. According to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11,000 years ago, at the beginning of the ninth millennium\\xc2\\xa0BCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch more archeological evidence, from approximately 3000 BCE,\\r\\nis available of our Estonian ancestors settling along the Northern Baltic coast (Virulased) and the South of the Finnish Straight (Livonians, Curlanders, Saarlased and others).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Estonia is thought to have originated from the Roman historian Tacitus, who reported in his book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGermania\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, that people he called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAestii\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, were living in Northern Europe, about where Estonia is located georgraphically now (in ca. 98 CE).\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a chronicle, when Danish Crusaders invaded Vironia (Northern\\r\\nEstonia) in 1210, they found beautiful wooded hills, where locals, especially\\r\\nthe Oeselian (Saaremaa) Vikings, worshipped a God called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaarapita\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nAccording to legend, Taarapita was born in Tartu and had flown from there\\r\\nto Saaremaa. Tartu is often presented as the cradle of Estonian civilization.\\r\\n(and it contained also Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own cradle). The hill were Taarapita is believed\\r\\nto have been born, is on the Ebavere Hill (Ebavere M\\xc3\\xa4gi). The Estonian\\r\\nVikings worshipped Taarapita from at least 800 to 1200. The original\\r\\nEstonians go back to the Ural Mountains of what is now Russia. There they \\r\\nhave been reported as also worshiping nature. That is, they truly were the first \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctree huggers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and environmentalists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaarapita\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been interpreted as the meaning of the plea \"Thor, help!\" (Taara a(v)ita in Estonian) and is associated with the Scandinavian god \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. 19th century creators of Estonian pseudomythology made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaara\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the supreme god of the Estonian pantheon. In the middle of the 19th century, Taara became popular as part of a neopagan faith within a rising national movement in Estonia. From that period, Estonia\\'s second-biggest city, Tartu, was poetically called Taara linn (\"Taara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s City\"). \\r\\n\\r\\nA small group of Estonians, today, are still believed to worship nature and Taara, to some degree, including myself. Michael, my son, and Janis were married by me, according to a ceremony that tried to follow Taara tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nVariations similar to the name \"Thor\" are known to many peoples who speak Finno-Ugric languages (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian). The Finno-Ugrics are thought to all originate from the Urals of Northeastern Russia. They lived in forests, there the Khants still have a god named Torum, the Samis people worship Turms, and the Samoyeds Tere. These tribes, living in Northern Russia, are thought to be the forefathers of Estonians.  Living in very difficult socio-economic-political conditions, they are seeking more autonomy from Moscow, for their peoples and trying to keep their culture alive. These small remnants of ancient peoples have been supported by the Estonian government after re-independence in 1991. Several workshops and cultural festivals have been held with representatives from all Ugru-Finn cultures. Stalin and his henchmen tried to exterminate these small peoples, and Estonians by murder, and by deporting them forcefully to Siberian slave labour camps. He failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to several medieval chronicles, ancient Estonians did not work on Thursdays (days of Thor) and Thursday nights were called \"evenings of Taara\". Sources say Estonians used to gather in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoly Woods\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (also called the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHiis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) on Thursday evenings, where a bagpipe player was usually sitting on a large boulder, while people danced and sang until the dawn. The Hiis commemorated the forest ancestry of Estonians. It was a sacred place for worship, celebrations such as weddings, places where community or extended family councils were held, and disputes were settled. Many Estonian country communities have preserved the customs of their ancient Hiis locations, where peace is demanded and no weapons are allowed. We established a Hiis on Janis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 family country property. Janis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 brother played the cello, on a large rock partly sticking out of the lake, during the wedding \\r\\n-- in keeping with the tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\n800 -- 1200 C.E.\\r\\nMany raids and counter raids by Estonian/Livonian Vikings and their neighbours took place around the Baltic Sea. Livonians were believed to be the first to sail against the wind, on the Baltic Sea, in superior design \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPiraticus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d boats. Among other attacks, they once kidnapped the Norwegian Queen Astrid and her son, the future King Olaf  Trygvesson \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and sold them to slavery. Estonian Vikings also looted and burned the ancient capital town of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSigtuna\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Sweden. The current location of Stockholm, is as a result much further inland, moved there by the Swedish King to avoid more surprise attacks by the Estonian Vikings. They apparently couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand how the Livonians could sail against South-West prevailing winds in the area. In fact they did not beat the wind straight on, but used beam settings of the sail to tack forward as shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fear of Estonian Vikings, at the time, spread far and wide. For example, the early Danish Christian priests used to pray to God during their weekly services for protection against the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLivonian Devils\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Estonians were thought to be magicians (probably because they were the first in the Baltic to be able to sail \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagainst the wind\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). They were demonized by the peoples they attacked and were accused of practicing child cannibalism, and other such awful things, etc. Of course much of this was an exaggeration because the Estonians were feared as enemies. In fact they lived peaceful family lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Viking Age (800 C.E. to 1100 C.E.), the power of any Viking ruler depended in a large measure on his ability to reward his followers (respect, booty, authority, etc.). Egotists, who were only interested in their own welfare, did not survive long as leaders or as Vikings. Many of the writers on (sensationalized) Viking history have got this wrong too. The Viking culture was comprehensive and advanced for their time, where actually poetry and poets received more honours than those who were only warriors, per se. It is true that some extremist Vikings (in general) sailed and plundered England, the coast of Europe and the settlements along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. They would land their warriors and carry their relatively light piraticus boats over land to surprise inland communities.\\r\\n\\r\\n1193\\r\\nPope Coelestinus III declared a Holy War against the Livonians (Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia/Curonia). Berthold was concecrated as the Bishop of Livonia, but failed to Christianize Livonians by brute military force. Many people chose to die, rather than to submit to a foreign, Christian, religion. \\r\\n\\r\\n(While visiting the upscale Harrod\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department Store in London, England, with shopper Mari, in the 1980s, Rein had an identity crisis/shock of his life. A very distinguished looking British gentleman/store clerk, after asking questions about Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal history, announced that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not Estonian but Livonian, possibly Curonian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  and then sold Rein an antique map of Livonia which still hangs on his wall. What a good salesman! What a place to have an identity crisis! After some research on his personal history, Rein decided that the British store clerk was probably right. He will forever be thankful for such the chance clarification of his identity.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Oeselians on the Island of Saaremaa, the Southern Estonians/Livonians/Curonians were the most feared Vikings on the Baltic Sea. They terrorized some of the Danes and other Scandinavians with their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdemonic/magic piraticus boats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  seeking food and booty.\\r\\n\\r\\nVikings lived in extended family communities headed by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (in Estonian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPealik\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cultimate leader\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). When under attack, neighbouring kings would combine their forces to defend their homeland against invaders. In subsequent years larger permanent groupings (like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLivonians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) were formed and lead by a king of kings. This became necessary to counter the larger armies of the Crusaders and others who were seeking to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 1200, Livonians/Southern Estonians rose up and the first War of Liberation of the Estonian Peoples started jointly with the support of the neigbouring Sakala and Ugala kingdoms. The Sakala/Ugala people have always been considered as independent individuals and still the best opportunity-driven entrepreneurs and actors in Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\n1198 -- 1202\\r\\nBishop Berthold was killed in battles with the Livonians. Pope Innocentius III then declared the Last Crusade sanctioned by a Pope -- against all the Baltic peoples. A larger Crusader army was sent to subdue the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheathens\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, who were thought to have no culture or religion of their own. Albert became the Bishop of Livonia (at Tartu) and continued the campaign to forcefully Christianize \\xe2\\x80\\x9call pagan Livonians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Livonians suffered several defeats, as did the Crusaders. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrder of the Brothers of the Sword\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was eventually formed by contracted German soldiers-of -fortune in Livonia. A powerful military unit of fanatical Christians, they were promised by the Pope immediate salvation upon their death and a place in heaven. This was a similar promise made by the Muslim Immans to the terrorists who kill themselves by setting off  bombs wrapped around their bodies, starting in late 1990s. While the Livonians, worshippingTarapita, were guaranteed to rise to Valhalla, only if they died in a noble fashion from protecting their home and hearth. Famous poets were promised the same fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a crazy world we live in.\\r\\n\\r\\n1217 \\r\\nSeptember 21. German knights suffered a major defeat around the hills of Otep\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4, just south of Tartu. To this day Estonians celebrate this as Madisep\\xc3\\xa4ev, to commemorate the first important Estonian/Livonian victory that protected Estonian/Livonian culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n1219 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1345. \\r\\nThis period is known as Danish times. To protect Denmark and to probably punish the Livonian Vikings, the Northern Estonians (Vironians), were subjugated on June 15, 1219 at The Battle of Lindanisa by the Danish king. Since that time, the Estonian capital (Reval) has been called \\xe2\\x80\\x98Tallinn\\xe2\\x80\\x99, a name which was derived from Estonianization of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTal-Linn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for \\xe2\\x80\\x98Danish Town\\xe2\\x80\\x99. According to Danish legend, a red cloth, with a white cross on it, fell from the sky during the battle, and from this day on, that symbol, called the Dannebrog, has been the flag of Denmark. This was the first successful, lasting, invasion of a significant portion of the Estonian domain.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1227\\r\\nA famous Estonian king (Pealik), called Lembitu, was killed fighting against the overwhelmingly larger forces of foreign oppressors at his Lehola Fortress in Southern Estonia/Livonia. He is worshipped today as an early hero.\\r\\n\\r\\n1328 \\r\\nThe Order of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Brothers of the Sword\\xe2\\x80\\x9dwas destroyed by the Livonians at the Battle of Saule. German knights, financed by Barons and the Catholic Church, immediately reorganized a new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrder of Livonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (all iron clad, with most modern armaments, of that time). This group of Christian soldiers of fortune continued the misconceived Crusade.\\r\\n \\t\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1343 \\xe2\\x80\\x931345\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 23, 1343, is celebrated annually as the St.George\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Night Uprising (J\\xc3\\xbcri\\xc3\\xb6\\xc3\\xb6 M\\xc3\\xa4ss). The start of the rebellion was signalled by the lighting of bonfires on all points of higher ground in Estonia, calling all local chieftains to rise up and fight for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEstonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, as a people, for the first time. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also a series of rebellions in 1343 - 1345 by the indigenous Northern Estonian-speaking population against foreign oppressors (mainly German Barons and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnobles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). It was arguably the single most notable uprising of Estonian-speakers against the local German-speaking upper class, which dominated Estonia from the 13th to early 20th century. Southern Estonians were eventually overpowered by the Crusaders, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLivonian Order of the Sword\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and were ruled by Christian Bishops/Crusaders from a Bishopric set up in Tartu.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new rulers imposed taxes and duties, and gradually reduced the indigenous population to serfs. Oppression hardened, as the new masters built manor-house palaces all over the country. But their impositions proved to be politically unstable. The Northern Estonian provinces of Harju and Viru were given to the Danish king to rule. However Danish power also proved to be weak. The Danish vassals/barons were mostly German-speaking settlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn St. George\\'s Night, April 23, 1343, Estonians in northern Harju county started a large uprising. They renounced Christianity, and killed mercilessly everybody with a German ancestry (chronicles give 1,800 as the total number of victims). Insurgents conquered the Cisterian monastery-fortress in Padise and tried to besiege Reval (German name for Tallinn), the provincial capital, which they promised to hand over to their ally, the king of Sweden. Other northern provinces, Laanemaa and Saaremaa, also joined the insurgency.\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurgents elected their own leaders and called them \"kings\" according to German chronicles. Four insurgent \"kings\" arrived as truce envoys to negotiate with the Livonian Order in Southern Estonia. The Estonian \"kings\" offered to obey the master of Livonia, provided they had no direct overlords over them; but the Livonian master demanded to know why they had killed so many Christian people, including 28 monks at Padise. The answer given was arrogantly that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 all Germans deserve to be killed, even if they were only two feet tall\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The master of the Livonian order did not like the answer and all four Estonian \"kings\" were hanged, even though they had arrived under a flag of truce, May 4, 1343.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 14th, the now leaderless insurgents of Harju lost the battle of Kanavere against the Livonian Order troops. Any remaining Estonian leaders were killed. Four days later the Estonian allies arrived (the Swedish-Finnish troops), but it was too late. They were received by the commander of the Livonian Order, who convinced them to keep a truce. A rebellion on the island of Saaremaa, traditionally the fiercest Vikings, lasted two further years. The Saaremaa \"king\" Vesse was put to death in 1344. The remaining insurgencies in Saaremaa were stifled in 1345. \\r\\n\\r\\n1346 \\r\\nFed up with constant rebellions by Estonians, Danes sold northern Estonia to the German Teutonic Order for 19,000 silver marks. The Teutonic Order then sold the territory to the German Livonian Order a year later\\xe2\\x80\\x94for a 1,000 mark profit. Until the 19-th century (approximately 700 years), German landowners subjugated Estonians in feudal serfdom, regardless who was in power. They were the de facto \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivil service\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, collecting taxes and providing for the soldiers whoever controlled the coutry. Today there are hundreds of historical Manor Houses (fancy country palaces), reminiscent of these times, where German Barons lived wealthy lives, subjugating the locals to servitude all over Estonia . \\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Baron domination lasted for such a long time that\\r\\nHitler and his gang, many years later, decided in the 1930s, that the Estonians were also \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAryans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, blue-eyed and blonde, his ideal for a German race that he wanted to create with Nazi terror. Subsequently many Estonian lives were saved because they were supposedly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAryan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe uprisings against German Christians are a popular subject of debates among Estonian historians and literati, some of whom claim that the uprisings were not a fight against Christianity, as such, but against the Livonian Order and the crimes they committed. Whatever, most Estonian peasants worshipped Taarapita and would be called today nature worshippers, (perhaps the original \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctree huggers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this era originate popular Estonian myths of a hero called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Avenger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Tasuja), who punished the invaders and barons and supported the peasants through individual ambush attacks, stories that sound a bit like Robin Hood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstonians were the last race to be Christianized in Europe. It took the Last Crusade and much blood to achieve the Catholic Pope\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unprovoked aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\n1524 \\r\\nEstonians were converted by force to Catholicism, but subsequently adopted Lutheranism, when Protestant Reformation reached Estonia. In 1535 the first Estonian language book, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCathechism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, (a religious book that interpreted the Bible according to the Catholic Popes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wishes) was published and forced upon the peasants. This turned out to be the major event in the evolving Estonian language (the first in written language).\\r\\n\\r\\n1578 \\r\\nAs reported in Livonian Chronicles in 1578, the arrival of Christianity had not ended pagan beliefs and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfertility\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rituals supposedly surrounding this holiday. Historians complained to the authorities about Estonians who went to church, but did not enter, and instead spent their time lighting bonfires, drinking, dancing, singing and following \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpagan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rituals. It was reported that many of the churches, at that time, had a tavern right next to it or across the road. The women and children went to church, while the men gathered at the tavern to carouse, argue and intrique.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 23, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJaanip\\xc3\\xa4ev\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, known popularily as St. John the Baptist Day, was celebrated long before the arrival of Christianity in Estonia.  Jaanip\\xc3\\xa4ev originally also marked the change in the farming year, specifically the break between the completion of spring sowing and the hard work of summer hay-making. The rituals of Jaanip\\xc3\\xa4ev have very strong folkloric roots. Best-known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJaanik\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, or midsummer, these rituals included the lighting of a bonfire and then jumping over it, holding hands with the one you love or are trying to impress. This was seen as a way of guaranteeing prosperity and avoiding bad luck. Women sometimes made crowns of flowers and danced around the equivalent of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaypole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (still practiced in Scandinavia). In the farming country, men showed off to their women, by doing daring tricks on giant wooden swings, circumnavigating the swing-supporting cross-beam, by revolving it in 360 degree circles. Even nowadays, young men, including Rein, have attempted such feats when visiting the rural areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaanip\\xc3\\xa4ev celebrations were eventually merged with the celebration of V\\xc3\\xb5idup\\xc3\\xbcha (Victory Day) after the War of Independence , when Estonian forces defeated the German troops (and the Barons) on 23 June 1919, and then drove the Russians out of Estonia. After these battles against Estonia\\'s traditional oppressors, Jaani\\xc3\\xb5htu and the lighting of the bonfires, again became linked with the ideals of independence and freedom. A bonfire is always lit by the Estonian President on the morning of June 23. From this fire, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflame of independence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is carried across the country to light the many bonfires in most communities of Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n1600s\\r\\nParts of Estonia briefly came under the control of Poland/Lithuania. Sigismund was elected to the Polish throne. Estonia and Livonia become the theatre for Polish-Swedish wars. The Polish cavalry reached Lake \\xc3\\x9clemiste outside Tallinn. In 1605, the army of Charles IX, of Sweden, being three times numerically superior, lost a large battle at Salaspils (Kirchholm) in Latvia; After repeated armistices the Swedish troops, during the course of new wars, were finally able to conquer Livonia and Curonia from Poland/Lithuania, including Riga in 1621 and Tartu in 1625.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory in turn was then conquered by the\\xc2\\xa0Russian Empire\\xc2\\xa0during the\\xc2\\xa0Great Northern War\\xc2\\xa0and, following the\\xc2\\xa0Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia\\xc2\\xa0in 1710, and formed into the\\xc2\\xa0Governorate of Livonia. Formally, it was then ceded to Russia in the\\xc2\\xa0Treaty of Nystad\\xc2\\xa0in 1721, together with\\xc2\\xa0Swedish Estonia\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Swedish Ingria.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1561 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1710 \\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Swedish Times\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. King Gustav Adolphous founded the University of Tartu and Estonian national identity started to become stronger and more developed, as Estonian peasants were granted more rights, but some serfdom continued. The university promoted Estonian history and language. Estonian literature, poetry and literature were recorded in books by poets, writers, academics, at The University of Tartu. \\r\\n\\r\\n(Tartu is Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home town. He was born there on October 23, 1937.  He recalls proudly, that at the age of 5, he was allowed to walk alone (safely) past the impressive, perhaps a little scary, main building of the University, on his way to visit his cousins, Reet and Mare Sarap. This is Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first memory of growing up and was to protend a lifetime career as an academic. It was also, in a building next to the main hall, that Rein first met his brother Tonu, 44 years after Tonu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth in 1944. Rein visited Tartu, and the University, in 1988, during Communist times, before the start of \\r\\nRe-independence in 1991. Before that, there had only been hesitant contacts through chess games via mail between T\\xc3\\xb5nu and Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout history, including during the 1944 - 1991 Soviet conquest, The University of Tartu, was the womb from which Estonian culture was born, stored and reborn. Tartu has become to be known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCradle of Estonian Culture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and it is from Tartu that the re-independence of Estonia, slowly boiled during the period of 1987 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\n1710 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1918 \\r\\nRussia conquered Estonia, though German Barons retained local control of the peasants. They provided the conquerors, as always, the civil bureaucratic structure that collected the taxes and subjucated the serfs. The battles with Russia, during this period, caused 80 percent of the 100,000 of Tallinn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population to die\\xe2\\x80\\x94mainly by starvation and the plague. \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon conquest of Estonia, the largely land-locked Russians gained a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWindow to the West\\xe2\\x80\\x9d through Estonia and thence via The Baltic Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Estonia became a part of the economy and the empire of the Russian Tsars. In 1816 the age-old system of serfdom in Russia and Estonia was finally abolished by a relatively benevolent Tsar Nicholas I. This was, in part, an attempt by the Tsar to maintain his power among the peasants and the richer farmers called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckulaks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. (When Stalin, some 120 years later came to power, he exterminated all the Kulak middle class, because he was afraid that they would revolt against his power.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the1890s, Estonian nationalism took on a more political tone, with intellectuals calling for more autonomy, and then, complete independence from the Russian Empire. \\r\\n\\r\\n1853 Russia was defeated in the Crimean War and it percipitated in 1861 the completer emancipation of serfs in the Russian Empire (including in Estonia). The Crimean War made Alexander II realize that Russia was no longer a great military power. His advisers argued that Russia\\'s economy could no longer compete with industrialized nations such as Britain and France. (History repeated itself again in 1991 when Soviet Union collapsed.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTsar Alexander told a group of Moscow nobles: \"It is better to abolish serfdom from above than to wait for the time when it will begin to abolish us from below\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlexander\\'s reforms did not satisfy liberals and radicals who wanted a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparliamentary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d democracy and the freedom of expression. The peasants in some some regions took nearly 20 years to obtain their land. Many were forced to pay more than the land was worth and others were given inadequate amounts for their needs.\\r\\n\\r\\n1865 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1869 Leo Tolstoy published the dome \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWar and Peace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, one of the greatest books of all time. He described many aspects of the Russian soul, and predicted that Russia had to re-invent itself. (Tolstoy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prediction of the need for re-invention continues even today in Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Russia). \\r\\n\\r\\n(A Short Historical Note on Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s many failed attempts at Re-invention follows. Tsar Nicholas II ruled from 1894 until his abdication in 1917. Then came Lenin, who died in 1924, and he founded the Communist Party. Stalin then usurped power and gained the effective leadership of Russia in 1929 and died in 1953 after a bloody and brutal reign. As Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1958 to 1964, Nikita Khrushchev was responsible for the de-Stalinization of the USSR. Mikhail Gorbatshov, followed and tried to reform the USSR economy and the Communist Party by introducing unsuccessful reforms, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerestroika\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlasnost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He served as the last General Secretary of the Communist Party and head of state of the USSR, from 1985 until its implosion in 1991. Boris Yeltsin became then the first President of the Russian Federation, serving from 1991 to 1999. In 2000, Vladimir Putin became the second President of Russia and has tried to transition (re-invent) the Russian economy towards capitalism, using high prices available from oil on the international markets. He became a tyrant by 2014, and invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. Russian expansionism is, once again, today, a major threat to Estonia.) \\r\\n\\r\\n1870 \\r\\nSt.Petersburg -- Tallinn railway was finished. Tallinn became a major port for the largely landlocked Russian Empire. Tallinn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population grew from 30,000 to over 100,000. St. Petersburg universities became an important centre for Estonian intellectuals, students, military officers and business persons. A special relationship between St. Petersburg and Estonia continues to this day, especially among Jewish Russians. They have for centuries, continued to come to P\\xc3\\xa4rnu for holidays and the therapeutic mud baths. St.Petersburg academia still has some influence in Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n1905 \\r\\nPoor peasants vented their anger, once again, at Czarist police and Baltic Germans, who still owned more than half the land in Estonia. Uprisings intensified during the Bolshevik \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOctober Revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 1917, with newly organized Estonian soldiers winning victories against a disorganized Red Army and the German \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFreikorps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The latter tried to prolong the power of the German feudal lords. Independence was declared on February 24, 1918. \\r\\n\\r\\nLivonia remained within the Russian Empire until the end of\\xc2\\xa0World War I, when it was split between the newly independent states of Latvia and Estonia. In 1918\\xe2\\x80\\x931920, both\\xc2\\xa0Soviet\\xc2\\xa0troops and German\\xc2\\xa0Freikorps\\xc2\\xa0fought against Latvian and Estonian troops for control over Livonia, but their attempts were defeated. The Treaty of Tartu was signed on February 2, 1920, granting Estonia its supposed freedom from Russia/Soviet Union, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperpetually\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Germans were also driven out from Estonia at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFAMILY HISTORY\\r\\n\\r\\n1864 February 13 Maria Redikort (Karl Aleksander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother and Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandmother) was born in Vanam\\xc5\\x8disa, Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n1868 Nov. 6 Karel Paulus (Karl Aleksander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, and Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandfather) was born in Tamsalu, Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\n1895 August 7 Karl Aleksander Paulus was born in N\\xc3\\xb5mmk\\xc3\\xbcla, J\\xc3\\xa4rvamaa in Estonia.

Tshita is just Southeast of the deepest lake in the world, Baikal. Mother (great-grandmother) Miina and (great grandfather), father of Romulus, Juhan were both born in Tartu,  Estonia. But Juhan Peterson worked as an officer in the Tsar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military organization, responsible for the maintenance of the Trans-Siberian Railway running along the Southern shore of Lake Baikal. The railway was built on a relatively narrow beach of the lake, because of the mountains along the northern shoreline. It was susceptible to constant washouts by waves and erosion. Captain (military rank) Juhan was an important man there, with considerable authority and responsibility. This was reported by Romulus. On an Estonian Passport, Romulus listed Tartu as his place of birth. But Tsita is listed on an earlier first Passport in T\\xc3\\xb5nu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possession.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Juhan was working in Siberia, Miina ran a small retail kiosk on the banks of the Emajogi River in Tartu. There were very few jobs available in Tartu. Romulus probably received his penchant for retailing from his parents, as they lived in poverty along with Salme (Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sister) in a shack next to their small retail kiosk. Juhan often drowned his sorrows in alcohol and was a poor provider, before he became employed on the Tsarist railway system. He was often away and Miina was left to fend for herself. She apparently was a saint, according to Romulus. (Juhan and Miina are paternal great grandfather and grandmother to Jenny and Mike). She must have visited Tsita, where Romulus was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow either Miina or Juhan must have read or come in contact with Roman history. I cannot imagine otherwise how someone would name a little baby \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRomulus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. A name that came from Roman mythology as one of the two twins (the other called Remus) who were brought up by a she-wolf in a cave outside of Rome. The brothers, Romulus and Remus, are credited with the founding of Rome . Perhaps great-grandfather Juhan, as a Captain in the Tsar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military, heard of the founding of Rome during discussions of the merits of the reigning Tsar (which is the Russian word for Ceasar). One can only speculate now. Personally, Rein cannot help thinking that maybe naming the baby has had some effect on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal interest in history and myths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWORLD WAR I STARTS\\r\\n\\r\\n1905\\r\\nRevolution swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for freedom of the press and assembly, for universal franchise, and for national autonomy.

He joined the Second Kuban Cossacks Division as an Adjudant (supporting the senior officer in command) and subsequently as a leader of a machine gunners company. He was wounded by a rifle bullet on his left side August 5, 1916 and by sharpnel in his left shoulder on June 24, 1917.

The first period of independence was therefore extremely short-lived, as the German troops entered Tallinn on the following day. The Germans did not recognize the claim for Estonian independence, and viewed it as an attempt by self-styled group usurping the sovereign rights of German nobility that had ruled as feudal lords for several hundred years in Estonia. The Baltic German minority even tried to found an independent United Baltic Duchy (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).\\r\\nThe German defense of Narva disintegrated over time as the Germans started to lose the war in Europe. A\\xc2\\xa0German Revolution, politically driven civil conflict in the\\xc2\\xa0German Empire, eventually\\xc2\\xa0resulted in the replacement of Germany\\'s imperial government with a\\xc2\\xa0republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the establishment of the\\xc2\\xa0Weimar Republic\\xc2\\xa0in August 1919.\\r\\nThe roots of the revolution lay in the German Empire\\'s negative fate in the First World War and the social tensions which came to a head shortly thereafter. The first acts of revolution were triggered by the policy of the Supreme Military Command\\xc2\\xa0and its lack of coordination with the\\xc2\\xa0Naval Command, who, in the face of defeat, insisted on engaging in a\\xc2\\xa0climactic battle\\xc2\\xa0with the British\\xc2\\xa0Royal Navy. There was no leadership among the German nobility/military power structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German forces, isolated under Petrograd and Narva started to withdraw Southward, toward Germany, and were eventually chased outside Estonian borders by newly formed Estonian forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 28 Recognizing an opportunity, the Russian forces attacked via Narva and almost reached Tallinn, before they were stopped and driven back by quickly assembled Estonian forces. The War of Liberation was now fully underway. Paulus was posted to the Defense League Headquarters to help plan overall Estonian defense. But this did not suit him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 10, until the end of the War, Paulus became directly engaged in fighting along the North shore of Estonia. He usually led small groups of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguerillas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that landed behind Russian lines by boat and attacked Russian positions by surprise from the rear. He served first as assistant commander of the 2nd Marines (Partisans) of the Kalev Regiment, and then as Commandant and finally as Batallion Commander.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Narva is today an Estonian border town of 70,000 people, 90 per cent Russian speaking, it is the third largest city in Estonia. It is dominated by 2 large ancient fortresses (Estonian and Russian) that straddle both sides of the Narva River. Therefore Narva, Estonia, is in fact a few hundred meters from the Russian border city of Ivangorod.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSince April, 2014 Narva has again been thrust into the geopolitical spotlight, since Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invasion and annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Some have suggested that Narva could be like Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if Russian president Vladimir Putin opted to test the NATO Alliance directly. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein, Mari, Tonu and Milvi, with cousins Reet and Mare, visited Narva in 2008, a local Estonian citizen described the milieu of Narva, as follows. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not ever wake the sleeping Russian Bear. Because when it wakes up it will become very aggressive like in the past. It is not a safe thing to do. This has been the experience of Narva for several hundred years\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 1918, Karl Paulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) greatest admirer and superior  officer ,was Johan Pitka, Contra-Admiral of the Estonian navy. Along with President Konstantin P\\xc3\\xa4ts and General Johan Laidoner, Chief of Estonian Armed Forces, they were the three organizers of the Estonian resistance to meet the attacking Russians, during the War of Liberation. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Johan Pitka\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book of memories (1914 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1919), called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRajus\\xc5\\x8dlmed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Knots of Peace) the following sections are copied that mention Captain Karl Alexander Paulus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Second Armored train left Tallinn for the front on December 11, 1918, the machine-gun wagon was under the command of Captain Paulus. Shortly after it was reported that Paulus lead a group of 32 men and captured the village of Maekula by rushing the Russian positions. At the age of 22, Karl Alexander Paulus was the youngest Captain in the Estonian armed forces, but impetuous.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Polkonvik Vahtamae was relieved of his command, Captain Paulus was named the leader of the Kalev Partisans/Marines Regiment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPaulus and his group captured the village of Kolga after leading 3 charges against Russian positions. They captured valuable materiel (for the time), including two machine guns, rifles, and ammunition. They suffered two wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaulus and his marines next attacked the Russians who were fortified at the Port of Kunda factory building and drove the Russians out. Paulus immediately stormed after the Russians. (He was later court marshaled for this action because it was judged that he had done this carelessly, with unnecessary casualties). The Russians had retreated to the Kunda Manor House. He and his men ran down the road without the benefit of information from scouts as to where the Russian soldiers were. They ran directly into the line of fire of a Russian machine gun and 2 Estonians were killed and several were wounded, including Paulus and his assistant, Burga. Paulus was wounded lightly and Burga seriously. The Estonian Marines panicked and deserted their positions, and ran trying to save themselves, abandoning their guns and equipment. In their haphazard retreat they ran into Admiral Pitka and his forces, who arrested the deserters and took them to the ship \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLembitu\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, that was waiting offshore.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Pitka ignored the misadventure and Captain Paulus and Major Ekstrom were asked by Pitka to prepare an attack plan for an assault on the city of Narva. Ekstrom lead a company of Finnish volunteers. The plan was to attack along the south shore of the Finnish Straight towards Hungerburg and then on to Narva. Using partisan/marine landing methods and surprise attacks in the enemy rear, capture of Narva was accomplished by Paulus and Ekstrom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Narva was captured, Captain Paulus was made the commandant of the border City of Narva. It became his duty to maintain order in the city. The Russian troops had abandoned their cannons and other materiel because they believed that their situation was hopeless, especially given that there were English navy ships standing just off shore. Major Ekstrom was asked to pursue the Russian troops into Ivanogrod across the Russian-Estonian border, the Narva River. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 23 In Europe,  German assaults reached the Allied Somme Line. The greatest air battle of the war took place over the battlefield as 70 aircraft were involved in a single combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 28 The German offensive along the River Scarpe was halted at great loss. The US Expeditionary Force played a vital role in the battle.\\r\\nApril 5 The German Spring offensive halted outside Amiens as Australian and British forces held the line. German forces withdrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 27 The French were forced back to the Marne River and held the line after being reinforced by US troops.\\r\\nJune 15 Massive offensive by the Austro-Hungarian Army and Italy and British forces hold the line. Then Allied forces destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Army, precipitating a collapse of the Empire.\\r\\nJune 15 Battle of the Marne inflicted irreplaceable German casualties and put the Germans on a complete defensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 30 British and Arab troops captured Damascus, taking 7,000 Turkish prisoners and securing stability in the Middle East.\\r\\nOctober 4 A German and Austrian peace proposal was sent to the US President Woodrow Wilson, requesting an armistice.\\r\\nOctober 29 German sailors aboard the High Seas Fleet mutinied.\\r\\nOctober 30 The Turkish army surrendered to the British in Mesopotania. Turkey signed an armistance with the Allies.\\r\\nNovember 8 Armistice negotiations between Allies and Germany began in Ferdinand Foch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s railway carriage at Cornpiegne.\\r\\nNovember 9 Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and civil revolution broke out in Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 11 Armistance was signed. World War I was at an end. We continue to celebrate this day as Rememberance Day with poppies.\\r\\n\\r\\n1919\\r\\nAround February 7 General Tonnison issued an order to arrest Captain Paulus . (Military bureaucracy moved slowly even in those days).  He was told that he had lost his rank of Captain and would be demoted to a rank of an ordinary soldier. The reason for this was given the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccareless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attack he and his men had made on the Kunda Manor House, resulting in casualties and desertions. In anger, Karl Paulus ripped off his own Captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insignia, from his shoulders and arms, and handed them over to an officer sent by General T\\xc3\\xb5nnison, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgive these to the general, they may make him into a real soldier\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. T\\xc3\\xb5nnison was more of a politician and bureaucrat, than a soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Pitka tried to have Paulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demotion reversed because Paulus was obviously an excellent leader of men. But he was over-ruled by the Generals at Headquarters. So Pitka made Paulus the head of the Marine Batallion, even though he only had the rank of an ordinary soldier. He was accepted by the men and officers as their legitimate leader. He subsequently lead his battalion in successful battles at Petseri (today Pechory,\\xc2\\xa0a small\\xc2\\xa0town in Russia of 12,000 with a few hundred ex-Estonians, near today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s City of Pskov). Paulus also captured the hamlets of Setomaa: Heinaste, Krakolje, Ostrovi, Peski, and Nishni-Luhshita in Southern Estonian County of Petseri, now East of the current Russian border. Petseri is famous for the\\xc2\\xa0mid-15th century Russian Orthodox\\xc2\\xa0Pskov-Caves Monastery, of the Belarus Orthox Order. Saint Peter\\'s Lutheran Church was built in 1926 at Petseri. In 1956,\\xc2\\xa0Pechory Secondary School No. 2\\xc2\\xa0was opened for Estonian-speaking students.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 16 Paulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 battalion was counter-attacked twice and was repulsed at Krakolje. Most of these battles were carried out by sailing down the Narva River and Peipsi Lake into V\\xc3\\xb5rtsjarv Lake. At each of these locations the Estonian marines would land and engage the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 17 Paulus captured Sisto-Palkino. He requested additional troops since he had conquered more area than his relatively small group could defend and hold. That was the last mention of Paulus in Pitka\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book. We do know from other sources that Paulus was eventually promoted to Captain again. His actions were subsequently honoured by decorating him with War of Liberation Cross. He thus became an Estonian Cavalier (like a British knight).\\r\\n\\r\\nMarta (Marfa in Russian) Sootal, as a little school girl in Tallinn, saw the handsome and dashing Captain Paulus, drive by in his fancy sleigh, pulled by spirited horses. She jumped on the runners that protruded beyond the back of the sleigh. The Captain was less than pleased (because of the danger involved) and threatened to hit her with his whip. As she jumped off the sleigh she yelled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to marry you some day!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 eventually, when she grew up to be a beautiful woman, and they got married and Kenneth Mehik (1938), Mary Ann (1940) and Linda Ann (1946) were born.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nAfter the War of Liberation (Vabaduss\\xc3\\xb5da), Paulus became involved in smuggling liquor from Finland across the Finnish Straight to Northern Estonia. He had the fastest motor boaton the Finnish Strait and the Estonian authorities were unable to apprehend him. Eventually they caught him, and rather than a jail for a famous Estonian war hero, they offered him the alternative of exile from Estonia. Paulus accepted this offer. Subsequently he was reported to have gone to Mexico to participate in the Mexican civil war. He was also reported several times to have been killed. But apparently he, eventually, crossed the US-Mexican border to Texas and earned a mining engineering degree from a university there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Petersons can also be proud to have a second Estonian Cavalier (equivalent of a knight in the U.K.) in the family. According to the Archives of the Estonian War of Independence (ERA F.495.  N.2.  S.2  Page 1021) the following information is recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 18 Daniel Andreimann had volunteered to join the Estonian National Armed Forces, and joined the Wide-Gauge Armored Train Nr. 5. On the Armored Train he served in the Scout/Reconnaissance Group as an ordinary soldier. After October 12, while fighting near the village of Stanki, he was promoted in the field to Corporal, because of his courageous acts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first battles in which Daniel Andreimann participated, were around the Strugi-Belaga railway station in Russia. When the Estonian froces retreated from Pihkva (now called Pskov) Daniel Andreimann participated in battles near the Moglino railway station. But the most serious battle which the young man (at the age of 24) had to live through was on 12 October near Pihkva, Podlijoje, Krasna Rejoka, and Stanki villages. Near the Village of Stanki, Daniel Andreimann was wounded in the left hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 12, on the Isborski battle line, he led a 13 man reconnaissance troop that had been sent out from the armored train to determine the exact location and strength of enemy forces. The troop approached the village of Pudlijoje, where the enemy had set up fortifications with 2 machine guns and many riflemen who met them with aggressive fire. This enemy fire not only made it difficult for the troop to move forward, but it pinned them down in a flat field. \\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Andreimann brazenly decided to stand up and charge the enemy fortification, by himself, firing his machine gun as he ran towards the enemy. They turned all their fire on him and he had to hit the ground. Without regard for his own safety, the brave young soldier continued to crawl towards the fortification and was able to come within 300 steps of the enemy position. From there he opened rapid fire from his machine gun hitting many of the enemy. When he saw that some of the Russian soldiers were retreating, Andreimann stood up and ran towards the fortified machine gun positions and captured them. During heavy enemy fire a bullet struck the left hand of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctemerously/rash young man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, (literally translated as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmad courage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). (As reported in the archieved dispatches). But, disregarding his wound, he continued to fire his automatic gun without hesitation, covering with his fire the reconnaissance troop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forward movement, which resulted in many enemy losses.  With these personal brave actions the young soldier emboldened the other Estonian reconnaisance troop members who followed him into the fight. They were able to capture all enemy positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually his hand became too weak to hold the automatic gun and he was evacuated from the field of battle. As a result he had to spend 4 months away from the Armored Train.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to note that both Paulus and Andreimann were fighting in the general area of the same battle ground. Paulus by water from Pihkva/Peipsi Lake, with his Partisans, and Andreimann leading a troop from armoured train number 5. Both became wounded and later were honoured as Estonian Cavaliers. Forty-three years later the two families were united by the marriage of Mari and Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 1919, the strength and morale of the Red Army had collapsed against the Estonian forces attacks fighting inside Russian borders.\\r\\n1920\\r\\nJanuary 3 Moscow agreed to an armistice with Estonian forces. This day is now celebrated as the Memorial Day of the Fallen in Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 2, 1920 the Tartu Peace Treaties were signed by Soviet Russia. The\\xc2\\xa0Treaties of Tartu\\xc2\\xa0were peace treaties between the\\xc2\\xa0Russian SFSR\\xc2\\xa0on one side and newly\\xc2\\xa0independent\\xc2\\xa0Estonia\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Finland, which had previously been parts of\\xc2\\xa0Imperial Russia, on the other. They were negotiated and signed in\\xc2\\xa0Tartu\\xc2\\xa0in Estonia in 1920 after the Finnish Civil War, and after war and a truce on January 1, 1920 between Bolshevik Russia and Estonia.\\xc2\\xa0Estonia had been a province of Imperial Russia since 1710, and had been subject to some sort of foreign hegemony since the 13th century.\\xc2\\xa0With the outbreak of the World War I, the Russian Empire fell into revolution and civil war. As a part of this larger conflict, the Estonians declared independence from Russia and won freedom during the\\xc2\\xa0Estonian War of Independence  (1918 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1920) .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty established the border between Estonia and Russia, affirmed the right of Estonian people to return to Estonia and required that Estonian movable property evacuated to Russia in\\xc2\\xa0World War I\\xc2\\xa0be returned to Estonia. Russia also agreed to absolve all debt from Tsarist times and to pay Estonia 15 million gold\\xc2\\xa0rubles, a proportional share from gold reserves of former\\xc2\\xa0Russian Empire. Additionally Russia agreed to grant concessions to exploit one million hectares of Russian forest land and to build a railway line from the Estonian border to Moscow. In return, Estonia undertook to allow the\\xc2\\xa0RSFSR\\xc2\\xa0to build a free port at Tallinn or some other harbour and to erect a power station on the\\xc2\\xa0Narva River. \\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 2\\r\\nFinnish Ingerland (\\xc2\\xa0Ingerimaa) is the geographical area located along the southern shore of the\\xc2\\xa0Gulf of Finland, bordered by\\xc2\\xa0Lake Ladoga\\xc2\\xa0in Russia,\\xc2\\xa0in the north, and by the\\xc2\\xa0River Narva\\xc2\\xa0on the border with\\xc2\\xa0Estonia\\xc2\\xa0in the west. In early 1500 about 67,000 Finnish Ingerlanders were recorded as living in 4 cities. Approximately 150,000 Finns were also reported as living in the same area claimed by the Ingerian Lutheran Church in the early 1900s. Ingerlanders had the misfortune of living where Peter the Great of Russia had decided to build his new capital, St. Petersburg. Therefore Ingerland as a whole never formed a separate\\xc2\\xa0state, nor were they\\xc2\\xa0understood to have been a nation, although the\\xc2\\xa0Soviet Union\\xc2\\xa0eventually recognized their \"nationality\" as an\\xc2\\xa0ethnic group. After the 1917\\xc2\\xa0Bolshevik revolution\\xc2\\xa0in Russia, a\\xc2\\xa0Republic of\\xc2\\xa0North Ingria\\xc2\\xa0(Pohjois Inkeri) declared its independence defiantly from Russia with the support of Finland and with the aim of incorporation into Finland.  Deportations of the Ingrian Finns\\xc2\\xa0started in late 1920s and Russification\\xc2\\xa0was nearly complete by the 1940s. As of 2016, Ingria continued to form the northwestern anchor of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x94its \"window\" on the\\xc2\\xa0Baltic Sea\\xe2\\x80\\x94with\\xc2\\xa0Saint Petersburg\\xc2\\xa0at its centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also approximately 15,000 Setos in the world. The bulk of Setos, however, are found in the\\xc2\\xa0Setomaa\\xc2\\xa0region, which is divided between south-eastern\\xc2\\xa0Estonia\\xc2\\xa0(P\\xc3\\xb5lva\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0V\\xc3\\xb5ru\\xc2\\xa0counties) and North-Western\\xc2\\xa0Russian Federation Pskov Oblast, where Setos are an officially protected ethnic minority .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0The town of Pechory was captured by Estonian forces on March 29, 1919, during the\\xc2\\xa0Estonian War of Independence. Pechory was renamed Petseri and the area became Petseri County. Saint Peter\\'s Lutheran Church was built in 1926 at Petseri. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992 about 4700 Finn Ingerlanders chose to return to Findland. On 1993 the Ingerland Church registered itself as being legally independent. On 1998 in Finland a Parliament was established for Finns living outside Finland and Ingerland was to be represented, to help people living in Karjala, Ingerland and Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Treaty of Tartu\\xc2\\xa0of 1920 subsequently assigned Petseri and its surrounding territory, the\\xc2\\xa0Setomaa\\xc2\\xa0region, to Estonia. Under the Russian-Estonian\\xc2\\xa0Peace Treaty of Tartu\\xc2\\xa0of 1920, a small part of West Ingria also became part of the\\xc2\\xa0Republic of Estonia about 1000 Ingrians lived in the area ceded to Estonia under the\\xc2\\xa0Peace Treaty of Tartu\\xc2\\xa0(1920).\\r\\nCuronia, was another location containing a small number of residents. It was not legally seen as an ethnic, but only as a social category, depicting North-Eastern Baltic seafarers, along the Baltic Sea coast, South of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Estonia. They had often engaged, in the past,in piracy, with Livonians. Linguist\\xc2\\xa0Eduard V\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4ri argues that it is possible that Curonians were Baltic Finns or Estonians. The last Curonian speaker died in 2013. \\r\\nUnfortunately, all three \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnationalities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were or are now on the verge of being obliberated from recognition in the world. All three have suffered severely from War. This makes the survival of the Estonian language and culture a significant achievement.\\r\\nFebruary 15 Daniel Andreimann rejoined the Armored Train Nr. 5. Because of his personal bravery in battle Corporal Daniel Andreimann was awarded  a III category, 2-nd level Freedom Cross, at the end of the Estonian War of Independence. He thereby also became an Estonian Cavalier (Knight)\\r\\n\\r\\n1921\\r\\nDecember 10 Andreimann, a Russian citizen, was granted an Estonian residency permit by the Chief of Police in Tartu. He then qualified for the financial rewards given to all veterans, as a decorated Freedom War Cavalier.\\r\\n\\r\\n1923 \\r\\nAugust 6 Corporal Daniel Andreimann was granted full Estonian citizenship. After the War of Liberation, Daniel became a traveling salesman. He travelled all over Western Russia, selling Estonian products and buying cheap goods from Russia for the Estonian Market. Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 store was one of his most important customers. He would travel with several heavy suitcases by train. This strain on his limbs eventually caused him to permanently injure himself and in his later years his veins would constrict (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdry up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and he had trouble with his balance in walking. But he never lost his good humour and wisdom. Becoming a traveling salesman probably came to him as a natural extension of having been born near the Estonian- Russian border.\\r\\n\\r\\n1924\\r\\nIn the early morning hours of December 1, a couple of hundred armed Communist conspirators attempted a coup d\\xe2\\x80\\x99etat in Tallinn. The conspirators killed approximately 20 people including the Estonian Minister of Transport Karl Kark. A crowd of citizens of Tallinn reacted quickly and crushed the attempted coup by congregating on Toompea and in front of the Palace. \\r\\n\\r\\n(This behaviour became commonplace in Estonia during several attempted coup d\\xe2\\x80\\x99etats. In 1991, Russian agitators tried to again capture the Parliament Buildings on Toompea). The mayor of Tartu, again, called on the citizens, by radio, to gather on the hills surrounding the parliament and protect it. Thousands did so. Some Estonian construction workers arrived driving huge construction equipment and rolled huge lime stone boulders to block the roads leading up the hill to the parliament and thereby stopping any Russian military vehicles from reaching the parliament buildings. These boulders were still there when Rein and Romulus visited Tallinn in 1991. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Communist coup organizers had believed that their planned uprising initiative would end with a Soviet invasion. They also believed that the Estonian working class would join them in a coup. This was a gross misjudgement, since such social class based revolutionary conditions had not developed in Estonia (like in Russia), and the majority of the population were proud of their recently won independence from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe big Russian bear\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n1928\\r\\nRomulus served his mandatory military service time in the cavalry/artillery. He became the head of Tartu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Number 1 Gun Battery. Later on, Romulus regaled us all with stories about Juss. His personal horse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJuss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. According to Romulus, Juss was a very smart and an experienced cavalry horse and Romulus was just a young recruit serving his required time in the army. Romulus recalled Juss lovingly and nostalgically. He recalled that Juss had a sweet tooth, and every morning he expected his treat of sugar cubes. Failing that, he would gently stand on Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 foot, while he was grooming the horse, until he received what he considered to be his due. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt an early stage of cavalry training, Romulus and Juss were cantering down a predetermined exercise path in the woods. They came to a fork in the road, and Romulus was not sure which branch was the correct one. So he pulled on Juss to go left, but Juss knew that was the wrong way. So Romulus proceeded left, while Juss turned right and waited until Romulus gathered himself off the ground and joined him. No love was lost between man and horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n1930\\r\\nSome time in the 1930s Karl Aleksander Paulus ended up in Africa as a gold mining engineer in the Gold Coast Colony (now Ghana) town of Takarady.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the end of World War I and the rise of the Nazi party, Germany was the only fully industrialized country that could plausibly have had a successful communist revolution. This was a claim made by both Stalin and Hitler. A communist Germany beginning in 1930 would have been the closest approximation to Marx\\'s original vision and became a reason for war between Russia and Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n1932\\r\\nThe Weimar German Republic, established after the First World War (1918), came to an end when an aging President Hindenburg and his advisers decided that they could control Hitler and therefore supported him politically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1933 \\r\\nHitler won personal election and became Reich Chancellor of Germany. Hitler had played politically to the fears of Communism. To many observers, the Russian/Bolshevik revolution looked like a Jewish conspiracy, especially when it was followed by Jewish-lead revolutionary outbreaks in many countries of Central Europe.The Russian leadership of the Bolshevik Party had a preponderance of Jews. The German Communist Party also was lead by many Jews.\\r\\n\\r\\n The Nazis, as a political party, never received a clear mandate in any free election. The majority of Germans did not buy the Nazi propaganda, when they had a free vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost immediately after Hitler\\'s seizure of power in 1933, Protestant Christians faced pressure to \"aryanize\" the Church, expel some Christians from the ordained ministry and adopt the Nazi \"F\\xc3\\xbchrer Principle\" as the organizing principle of church government. In general, the churches succumbed to these pressures, and some Christians embraced them willingly. The pro-Nazi \"German Christian\" movement became a force in the church. They glorified Adolf Hitler as a \"German prophet\" and preached that racial consciousness was a source of revelation alongside the Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\nA \"Confessing Church\\xe2\\x80\\x9d emerged in opposition to the Nazi-oriented German Christians. Its founding document, the Barmen Confession of Faith, declared that the church\\'s allegiance was to God and scripture, not a worldly\\xc2\\xa0F\\xc3\\xbchrer. The Barmen Declaration expressly asserted that Christ alone was the only Word of God \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the source of all authority and truth \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whom we must hear, trust and obey. It rejected the notion that other powers apart from Christ (i.e. Hitler) could be source of God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the Confessing Church and the Nazi German Christians remained part of the German Evangelical Church, and the result was a Kirchenkampf, or church struggle within German Protestantism. It was an ongoing debate and struggle for control between those who sought a \"nazified\" church, and those who opposed it. The Protestant Kirchenkampf  turned out to be mostly an internal church matter, not a fight against Nazi National Socialism or the Holocast, per se.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1934, at the Barmen Meeting, the emerging \"Confessing Church\", adopted a declaration drafted by Reformed theologians Karl Barth and Lutheran theologian Hans Asmussen, which expressly repudiated the claim that other powers apart from Christ could be sources of God\\'s revelation. Not all Christians courageously resisted the regime, but many who did\\xe2\\x80\\x94like the Protestant pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Roman Catholic priest Bernhard Lichtenberg\\xe2\\x80\\x94were arrested and executed in concentration camps. The spirituality of the Barmen Declaration profoundly influenced many of the new first generation of pastors, in the post-War period, as well as laypeople, that formed, after the War, the United Church of Christ in 1957.\\r\\nUnfortunately Barth and Asmussen never challenged the Nazi concentration camps in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n1934 -- 1940\\r\\nThe radical right in Estonia, called The Veterans\\' League (soldiers who had fought in the War of Liberation), was accused of planning to carry out a, coup d\\'etat in 1934. However, President Konstantin P\\xc3\\xa4ts took personal control (as a dictator) and subsequently ruled the country by decree until Russian occupation in 1940. \\r\\n\\r\\nKonstantin P\\xc3\\xa4ts, one of the heroes of the of the 1918 War of Liberation, has been credited for almost single handedly convincing Estonians, at that time, that they had what it took to create a democratic, independent Republic. Estonia was indeed free and independent, however, after P\\xc3\\xa4ts\\' coup in 1934, Estonian politics could hardly be considered democratic. The P\\xc3\\xa4ts constitution (adopted in 1938) was in many respects more authoritarian than that proposed by the Veterans\\' League (who were accused of being Fascist). The political power was now concentrated in the presidency, held by P\\xc3\\xa4ts. The Riigikogu (parliament) became little more than a debating society.\\r\\n\\r\\n1935 \\r\\nEstonian government became increasingly frantic about the threat from Soviet Russia to the east and Nazi Germany to the southwest. They placed their hopes for security, as an independent country, on protection from other Western European nations (especially The League of Nations). They eventually discovered that no help would be provided to Estonia. In the meantime, Estonian economy prospered, with GDP reaching or surpassing other Nordic country levels.\\r\\n\\r\\n1936 \\r\\nHitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army marched into the Rhineland (France).\\r\\n\\r\\n1937 \\r\\nJune 29. Lyon Mackenzie King, prime minister of Canada, was encouraged by Neville Chamberlain, the dishonoured prime minister of Britain, to visit Berlin, because of the sceptre of war was again creeping up on Europe. King was captivated by Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charms and wrote in his diary that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe smiled very pleasantly \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 affectionate look in his eyes\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 As I talked to him, I could not but think of Joan of Arc. Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior was distinctly mystic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Both Chamberlain and King turned out to be ignorant fools who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t face the facts. Mackenzie King practiced mysticism and believed he could communicate with his dead mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 23.

Estonia declared itself neutral.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 23, 1939 The secret Non-Aggression Treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) was signed in Moscow.\\r\\nOct. 28, 1939\\xc2\\xa0As the result of military threats by the Soviet Union, a mutual \\xe2\\x80\\x9cassistance pact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between Estonia and the Soviet Union was signed in Moscow, on the basis of which Soviet military bases were established in Estonia. Similar agreements, through which the USSR began to fulfil the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, were forced on Latvia and Lithuania.\\r\\nSeptember 25, 1940. Soviet scout planes flew over Estonia to scope out the strength of German and Estonian troops. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the War it was estimated that the Soviets had gathered on the Estonian borders the 8-th Army consisting of 136,250 soldiers, 1500 cannons, 1300 tanks, 160 armoured cars, 7800 other vehicles. Their orders were to be prepared for an attack on September 29.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 26 Estonian emissary was sent by Estonian President P\\xc3\\xa4ts and General Laidoner to K\\xc3\\xb6nigsberg to meet with a Nazi General who informed him that Germany had signed a peace treaty with Germany and cannot help Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly Latvia and Lithuania were afraid of becoming involved, as was Finland and the Scandinavian countries. It became clear that Estonia was to face the Soviet armies alone. President P\\xc3\\xa4ts decided that his only alternative was to seek some sort of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the Soviet Union. Emissaries were then sent to Moscow for negotiations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a Masters Thesis, written by Urmas Salo at Tartu University in 2005, Salo concluded that Estonian Defense Forces were not ready for war against a superior enemy in September, 1939. Without any military aid from other countries, Estonia would not have been able to attack the invading enemy on the eastern front for a month or two. \\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 6. Poland surrendered and a couple of thousand Estonians living in Poland escaped home to Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 18 Estonia was forced to secede territory for Russian military bases. Western countries did not come to the aid of Estonian independence. A total of 21,347 soldiers and aviators, 283 tanks, 54 armored cars and 255 airplanes were moved onto bases on Estonian soil by the Soviet Union, from where they subsequently overwhelmed Estonian forces in 1940.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 16 Russians attack Estonia and overwhelm their small armed forces (e.g. Estonia had only 8 outdated trainer/fighter airplanes). Taking advantage of the fact that the world\\'s attention was on Paris being occupied by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union occupied Estonia and began to destroy the existing national order.  The first people targeted in Estonia were local Russians.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 14 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 15 The Soviet forces carried out illegal elections with fraudulent results, as a result of which Soviet order was declared in all the Baltic states. These illegal elections became the basis for the Western world\\'s non-recognition policy of Soviet control of the Baltic States during the next half a century (until 1991).\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 21 Small group of opportunistic Estonian Communists claimed that Estonia had not been invaded by Russians, but that the Estonian workers had risen up to welcome the Russian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberators\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The same procedure was followed in Latvia and Lithuania. Communist conspirators declared an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEstonian Soviet Socialist Republic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 retail store was confiscated by Soviet police (KGB), he/we lost all personal property with no compensation and the Peterson family escaped from Valga to Tartu.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstonians who had fought in German armed forces were declared \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNazi collaborators\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and were either shot or deported to Siberia. During the first Soviet occupation (1940-1941), men serving in the Estonian forces were transferred into the Red Army. Added to this was the forced Soviet mobilization of Estonian men in 1941, many of whom later died in forced labour camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of ordinary Estonians, were selected by Communist agents randomly, to meet their quotas needed to fill cattle wagon trains waiting at railway stations, to be deported to Siberia. To this day Estonians remember the ominous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKNOCK !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the door by Soviet secret agents was something that everyone in Estonia dreaded and some of the older folk remember vividly, today.\\r\\nJune 8The USSR Supreme Soviet decided \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto accept the application\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Estonian SSR into the USSR. With that, the annexation of Estonia was complete. \\r\\nJune 14 Soviet authorities organised the first\\xc2\\xa0mass deportations\\xc2\\xa0in the Baltic states, during the course of which over 10 000 people from Estonia were sent to prison labour camps (Gulags) in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 22 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and occupied Estonia from July 1941 until September 1944, after which the Soviet Union re-established its occupation.\\r\\nJuly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 October 1941\\xc2\\xa0Military activity between the units of Nazi Germany and the USSR took place on occupied Estonian territory. Upon local initiative, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForest Brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that had worked for Estonian independence, underground, took over power from Soviet officials in many local municipal governments. In many places these hopeless efforts were accomplished by the rule of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmob law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over local Communists.\\r\\nJuly 15\\xc2\\xa0The German authorities set up a German civilian administration in Estonia to show that one occupation had been replaced by another.\\r\\nIn a report by the Nazi security police, Estonia was the first occupied Eastern territory to be declared \"free of Jews\". By that time, most of the 1,000 Jews that remained in Estonia in 1941, as well as several hundreds of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGypsies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (owning farms in South-East Estonia, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSetomaa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), had been executed by the German security police. After that the Nazi German authorities brought Jews from other occupied European countries to concentration camps in occupied Estonia, and in 1944 the number of Jews killed was approaching 10, 000.\\r\\nJan 14, 1942 An Estonian opposition centre was formed in Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia, recommended that Estonians contribute only to Western nations and refrain from Nazi mobilisation. This brought about severe oppression by the Nazi forces.\\r\\nAug. 12, 1942\\xc2\\xa0The German powers announced the formation of an Estonian Waffen SS Army. Due to the unpopularity of the German occupation, only slightly more than a thousand volunteers came together. As a result, in 1943 and 1944 the Nazis employed massive forced drafts.\\r\\nAug. 2, 1944\\xc2\\xa0A Free Estonian Infantry Regiment was formed in Finland. It consisted of 3,400 Estonians that had fled to Finland during the Nazi mobilisation (they were called \"The Finnish Boys\"). It was hoped that this regiment would some day help Estonia recapture its independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 November 1944\\xc2\\xa0The siege of Leningrad failed. Nazi German forces retreated and the forces of the USSR advanced and reoccupied Estonian territory.\\r\\nSept. 20, 1944\\xc2\\xa0The National Committee of the Republic of Estonia handed power to a Government formed by J\\xc3\\xbcri Uluots, the last constitutional pre-war prime minister of the Republic of Estonia and who had served as President. He attempted to restore the independence of the Estonian nation during the changeover of occupiers. Eventually J\\xc3\\xbcri Uluots, had to flee to Sweden, he created an exile government there, which together with the embassy in London and a consulate general in New York maintained the claim of Estonian independence abroad until 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn\\xc2\\xa0World War II\\xc2\\xa0Estonia had suffered huge losses. Ports had been destroyed, and 45% of industry and 40% of the railways had become damaged. Estonia\\'s population had decreased by one-fifth, about 200,000 people. Some 10% of the population (over 80,000 people) had fled to the West between 1940 and 1944. More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. \\r\\nThe resistance of the local people against the occupation forces continued in the forests. The last \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForest Brother\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was killed in 1978, thirty-four years after occupation. He had been kept alive by the support of the local people living in the farming country. It was estimated that at different times there could have been as many as 30,000\\xe2\\x80\\x9335,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartisans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who participated in guerilla activities as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForest Brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 15, 1945 END OF WORLD WAR II IN EUROPE.\\r\\n\\r\\n                      -----------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nA SHORT HISTORY OF SOVIET/RUSSIAN RULERS, 1941 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n1941 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1953 Joseph Stalin (Terror and Industrialization)\\r\\nUnder Stalin\\'s rule, the concept of \"socialism in one country\" became a central tenet of Soviet society, a highly centralised\\xc2\\xa0command economy. A rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an industrial power was forced upon the poor, destitute, intellectuals, military and peasants. The economic changes coincided with the imprisonment of millions of people in\\xc2\\xa0correctional labour camps and the\\xc2\\xa0deportation\\xc2\\xa0of many others to remote areas in Siberia.\\xc2\\xa0The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of 1932\\xe2\\x80\\x931933, known as the\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHolodomor\\xc2\\xa0in Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Major figures in the Communist Party, such as the\\xc2\\xa0old Bolsheviks,\\xc2\\xa0Leon Trotsky, and several\\xc2\\xa0Red Army leaders, were killed after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the government of Stalin. Stalin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power was based in part on being a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwar hero\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Nazi German\\xc2\\xa0troops\\xc2\\xa0had invaded the Soviet Union\\xc2\\xa0in June, 1941, and reached the very outskirts of Moscow, but were repulsed by the Russian people in December. On Stalin\\'s orders, the USSR had launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 15, 1945 First post-war deportation took place in Estonia, during which more than 400 local Germans were also deported to Siberia. March 25 -27, 1949\\xc2\\xa0Mass deportations from Estonia\\xc2\\xa0to Siberia. According to the information available, 20,702 people were deported, of which 20.8% were men, 49.4% were women, and 29.8% were children. Of these people about 3,000 perished in Siberia. \\r\\n\\r\\nStalin died in March, 1953\\xc2\\xa0and his death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev, after several years, eventually emerged victorious.\\r\\n\\r\\n1953 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1955 Georgi Malenkov (Interim).\\r\\n\\r\\n1955 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1958 Nikolai Bulganin (Interim).\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 29.1955\\xc2\\xa0The Estonian World Council was created in exile, with the goal of bringing together all Estonians abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n1956\\xc2\\xa0With the end of the Stalin personality cult and terror came a certain degree of softening in the political climate in Estonia. Many of those deported to Siberia had an opportunity to return to Estonia.\\r\\n1958 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1964 Khrushchev Era (Thaw and De-Stalinization)\\r\\n\\r\\nKhrushchev denounced Stalin in the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet on two public occasions in 1956 and 1962.\\r\\nAfter\\xc2\\xa0Stalin\\'s death, Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include many more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized. On the eve of\\xc2\\xa0Perestroika\\xc2\\xa0the Estonian Communist Party claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 7% of the country\\'s population. Most were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccareerists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who needed Party membership to advance from/in their work positions (as apparatchics).\\r\\nOne positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the regranting of permission in the late 1950s for citizens to make contact with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with\\xc2\\xa0Finland, and in the 1960s, a ferry connection was opened from Tallinn to\\xc2\\xa0Helsinki\\xc2\\xa0and Estonians began watching Finnish television. This electronic \"Window on the West\" afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. \\r\\nFor thirteen days in October 1962 the world waited\\xe2\\x80\\x94seemingly on the brink of nuclear war\\xe2\\x80\\x94and hoped for a peaceful resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Krushchev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrogance and a confrontive, non-diplomatic, peasant background brought the Cold War World to the brink of nuclear war over missile bases built by Soviet Union in Cuba. Krushshev, had to back off, and was humiliated by Western Powers lead by President John Kennedy of the the USA.  \\r\\nLeonid Brezhnev, a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev\\'s removal from power.

The literal meaning of perestroika was \"restructuring\", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system. Gorbachev was a Communist who believed in the Communist system. He set upon trying to reform the USSR.\\r\\nIn May 1987 the unauthorised landing of German amateur aviator,\\xc2\\xa0Mathias Rust,\\xc2\\xa0next to\\xc2\\xa0the Kremlin,\\xc2\\xa0enabled Gorbachev to remove many hardline opponents of his reforms, including Defense Minister Marshal\\xc2\\xa0Sergei Sokolov, to consolidate his authority.\\r\\nIn September 1987, the\\xc2\\xa0Edasi\\xc2\\xa0newspaper (in Tartu) published a proposal by Edgar Savisaar, Siim Kallas, Tiit Made and Mikk Titma calling for Estonia to make the transition to autonomy. Initially geared toward economic independence, then toward a certain amount of political autonomy, the project, Ise-Majandav Eesti\\xc2\\xa0(A Self-Managing Estonia) became widely known according to its Estonian acronym, IME, which means \"miracle\" in Estonian.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0The dismantling of the principal defining features of\\xc2\\xa0communism\\xc2\\xa0 began in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union and led to the unintended consequence of breaking-up the Soviet state into 15 successor states, after the failed\\xc2\\xa0August Coup of 1991\\xc2\\xa0led by\\xc2\\xa0Gennady Yanayev. \\r\\nBy the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The Estonian Communist Party remained stable in the early Perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the\\xc2\\xa0Estonian Popular Front, established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership and broad constituency. The\\xc2\\xa0Greens\\xc2\\xa0and the dissident-led\\xc2\\xa0Estonian National Independence Party\\xc2\\xa0soon followed.\\r\\n1989 Rein was recruited by the Estonian Popular Front, and visited Estonia giving covert speeches in Tallinn, Kuresaare and Parnu, on the merits of Entrepreneurship, Capitalism and IME (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Self-Managing Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Proposal developed by the Estonian Popular Front).\\r\\n1991 -- 1999 Boris Yeltsin (Dismantelled Soviet Union and Its Power)\\r\\nA blunt-talking reformer, he rapidly set about renovating the corrupt \"Moscow machine,\" and was elected a candidate member of the Politburo in 1986. In June, 1991 he was elected the first President of the Russian Federation.\\r\\nYeltsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stature rose in August 1991 when he climbed atop a tank to denounce a coup attempt against his rival Gorbachev. The coup, led by conservative Soviet officials, failed after three days. Immediately thereafter, Yeltsin set about dismantling the Communist Party, and all 15 of the Soviet Union\\xe2\\x80\\x99s republics moved to secure their independence. Gorbachev, who with his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperestroika\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglasnost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program had hoped to change but not destroy the Soviet Union, resigned on December 25, 1991. Six days later the Soviet Union officially dissolved and was replaced by a politically weak Commonwealth of Independent States that Yeltsin had established along with his counterparts in Ukraine and Belarus.\\r\\nWith the Soviet Union out of the way, Yeltsin eliminated most price controls, privatized a slew of major state assets, allowed for the ownership of private property and otherwise embraced free market principles. Under his watch, a stock exchange, commodities exchanges and private banks all came into being. But although a select few oligarchs became shockingly wealthy, many Russians lapsed deeper into poverty due to rampant inflation and the rising cost of living. Yeltsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Russia also struggled with the taint of being an ex-superpower and with corruption, lawlessness, decreased industrial output and falling life expectancies. Moreover, Yeltsin began treating himself to some of the perks, such as chauffeured limousines, that he had previously criticized. \\r\\nAs president, Yeltsin broke from his Soviet predecessors by generally supporting freedom of the press, permitting public criticism and letting Western popular culture seep into the country. He also agreed to nuclear arms reductions and brought home soldiers from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. Nonetheless, he did not completely disavow military action. After surviving impeachment proceedings, Yeltsin disbanded the communist-dominated parliament in September 1993 and called for elections to a new legislature. He then resolved the ensuing standoff by ordering tanks to shell the Russian parliamentary building, where the extremist coup leaders had set up their headquarters. After nine years as President, Yeltsin decided Russia needed new leadership and resigned the position to Vladimir Putin. Rein believes that he also succumned to Alcoholism.\\r\\n\\r\\n2000  --  Unknown Future.   Vladimir Putin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Medvedev \\r\\n\\r\\n(Putinism \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Restoring Soviet Era Borders and Power.) Although it might seem on the surface that the Putin regime hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed since 2000, in fact there have been profound changes, and in the two years since his re-election the President he has in effect created Putinism Mark 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutinism Mark 1 lasted from 2000 until the 2004 presidential election. It was based on a form of collective leadership by the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x98Yeltsin Family\\xe2\\x80\\x99, with Putin acting as merely the first among equals. By 2004, Putin had removed all other Family members from political power, and established himself as sole ruler.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutinism Mark 2, whose architect-in-chief was Vladislav Surkov, the Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration, lasted from 2004 until the winter of 2011-2 and included the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev, who made lots of loud noises about reform but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually change anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutinism Mark 3 began to develop as soon as Surkov was replaced by Vyacheslav Volodin as Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration in October 2010. Today its core elements are all in place and we will probably find out about what Russia will be like for the next few years.\\r\\nThe new, more hard-line model has arisen in response to Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic stagnation. Without money to buy the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s votes, he had to resort to a mass brainwashing programme in order to awaken in them an \\xe2\\x80\\x98unconditional love for the regime\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\r\\nOn 4 March 2012, Russians went to the polls to elect a new president, and returned Vladimir Putin for his third term in office. Since then he has been putting the finishing touches to his personal ideology \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 PUTINISM. The extent of his apparent personal egoistic goal, to re-establish a Russian Empire, like in the past, was still unclear on January 1, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economist, published in the UK, on March 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 25, 2016, concluded that Putin had become a Hollow Superpower. Mr. Obama believes that Mr. Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adventures in Ukraine and Syria betray a fundamental misunderstanding of how power works in foreign policy. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Real power means you get what you want without having to invoke violence\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first two presidential terms which ran from 2000 to 2008, were sold under the banner of political stabilisation and economic growth. The third begun in 2012, has brought neither of these things. Russia is not becoming any more stable, but is distinctly worse. The economy contracted by 4% last year. Disposable incomes have been falling since 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Putin feels a need for his current policy to be reconfigured as suitable for a wartime presidency (i.e. Ukraine, Crimea, perhaps Georgia and Syria).\\r\\n\\r\\n                               --------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTINUING WITH PERSONAL HITORY RECOLLECTIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n1940\\r\\n\\r\\nMarfa and Kenneth left on the last scheduled boat from Tallinn to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 10 German armies invaded Netherlands, Belgium and France.\\r\\nAugust \\xe2\\x80\\x93 September: The\\xc2\\xa0 Battle of Britain takes place. After the surrender of France, Britain was left by herself to face the Nazi war machine. The Battle of Britain remains as one of the most famous battles of World War II. The Germans needed to control the English Channel to launch their invasion of Britain (which the Germans code-named Operation \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sea Lion\\xe2\\x80\\x99). They needed to control the skies over of the Channel so that the superior British Navy would not be able to attack their invasion barges which were scheduled to land on the Kent and Sussex beaches. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo control the Channel the Germans attempted to control the air space. To prevent this, the available main fighter planes of the RAF were only the Spitfires and the Hurricanes. The Germans relied primarily on their Messcherschmitt fighters and their Junkers dive bombers - the famed Stukas.\\xc2\\xa0The German planes were considered superior and out numbered those available to the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 11 Mari is born in London, England at St. Mary Abbot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hospital in the middle of the bombing. After the bombing Blitz, Mari, Kenneth and Marta are evacuated from London to the town of Mountain Ash, in the coal mining region of Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of the battle, the Luftwaffe had 2,500 planes that were serviceable and on any normal day, the Luftwaffe could put up over 1,600 planes. The RAF had 1,200 planes on the eve of the battle which included 800 Spitfires and Hurricanes - but only 660 of these were serviceable. The rate of British plane production was good - the only weakness of the RAF was the fact that they lacked sufficient trained and experienced pilots. Trained pilots had been killed in the war in France and they had not been replaced.\\xc2\\xa0Pilots from Commonwealth nations, including Canada were recruited to ease the shortage.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\nBritain had a number of advantages over the Luftwaffe. Britain had RADAR which gave them an early warning of the approach of the German planes. By 1940 Over 1000 Radar outposts had been established. British fighter planes could spend more time in the air over Kent and Sussex as they could quickly land and re-fuel, whereas the German fighters could not, and had to return to Germany to refuel, a flight of several hours. Also German bombers could fly for longer distances, but their fighter planes could not provide needed protection cover. Therefore the bombers became vulnerable to attack by British fighter planes and many were shot down. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Britain started on July 10th 1940 when the Luftwaffe attempted to gain control of the Straits of Dover. The aim of the Luftwaffe was to tempt the RAF out for a full-scale battle. By the end of July, the RAF had lost 150 aircraft while the Luftwaffe had lost 268. In August, the Luftwaffe started to attack Fighter Command\\'s airfields, operation rooms and radar stations - the idea being that the RAF could be destroyed on the ground so that the Luftwaffe need not fight them in the air. Without radar the RAF would have been seriously hampered in terms of receiving any early warning of attacking Luftwaffe planes.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne event did greatly aid the British. The head of the Luftwaffe - Herman Goering - ordered an end to the raids on radar bases as he believed that they (the RADAR) were too unimportant to matter. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter research/ study of the situation, Rein concluded that Goering and Hitler had better war materiel ready to be introduced to the War in about 6 -12 months. The Nazis were on the verge of developing a Stealth bomber, much superior Jet fighter planes, the Atomic Bomb, Conventional long range guns, Cross-channel guns, more accurate V3 rockets fired from super long gun barrels, Me-163 Komet fighter plane, non-piloted aircraft, Kamikazi planes, gliders, Super Tanks, Self-propelled guns of many types, Nazi UFOs, Flying Saucers, Space age research, Vertical take-off planes, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peenem\\xc3\\xbcnde Military Test Site\\xc2\\xa0was one of the most modern technological facilities in the world in the years between 1936 and 1945. The first launch of a missile into space took place here in October, 1942. Rocket engineers tested numerous flight objects equipped with revolutionary technology. From the start this research was directed toward one goal only: achieving military superiority\\xc2\\xa0through advanced science. The Research Center was made up of more than 100 highly qualified scientists and engineers. There was also unlimited manpower from slaves from the Concentration camps to work the production factories.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike typical scientists they pursued science and quality, before cost and immediate military use. For example, Verner Von Braun, the scientist in charge had a personal goal of achieving space travel (which he finally achieved in the US). There was a lack of leadership for producing effective weapons quickly. But the potential at Peenemunde was enough for the Germans to win the War. Fortunately the weapons under research saw limited use. But the potential imminenr availability effected German strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change of strategy in bombing the cities, gave the depleted Nazi Fighter Command time to recover from its losses and for pilots to recover from the many hours a day that they operated which took many of them to the brink of exhaustion and numerous deaths of experienced pilots lead to serious\\xc2\\xa0shortage.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 15th came the last major engagement of the battle. On that day, it is believed that the RAF was outnumbered four-to-one and if they had failed to beat off this massive attack, the Germans would easily have been able to invade the UK. RAF Hurricanes and Spitfires surprised the German two-wave attack by meeting them over the English Channel and earlier. According to the RAF, 176 enemy aircraft were destroyed by UK fighter planes. At least another nine aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft guns. British casualties were much lighter - only 25 aircraft lost with 13 pilots killed. On September 17th, Hitler postponed indefinitely the invasion of Britain, although the night time raids -the Blitz- continued and London, Plymouth and especially Coventry (almost completely destroyed) were all badly hit by the raids that followed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the Battle for Britain, the British government propaganda claimed that the RAF had shot down 2,698 German planes. The actual figure was more like 1,294. The RAF lost 788 planes - far fewer than the 3,058 the German propaganda claimed to have shot down. In 2004 UK unveiled a Battle of Britain Monument in London listing 2,935 airmen from 14 countries who flew in the Battle. Canadian pilots numbering 113 men were the largest group from outside UK. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, and the person credited with the organization of the defense of Britain, said in his most famous speech:\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to so few!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems now, that Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s war strategy was to attack countries who were seen as being weak and unable to defend themselves \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Poland, France and then United Kingdom. Finding his losses in the UK too high, he decided (mistakenly) to attack the Soviet Union instead, where Stalin had delayed military defense preparations. But Hitler was wrong again. The large land area of the Soviet Union, unsuitable for tanks, with far too long supply lines and a very cold winter, bogged down the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlitzkrieg\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and gave Stalin, with the support of the US and other allies, time to recover. The ferocity of the Russian soldiers who counter-attacked, in defending their homeland, which had been brutally violated by German soldiers, also caught Hitler off guard. Personally, today, it is surprising how early the Battle for Britain occurred. We lived in Estonia for 4 more years, after the Battle for Britain, Rein was 3 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n1941\\r\\nJune 14 Mass deportations by Stalinist forces from Estonia, targeted the elite of Estonian society. Intellectuals, leaders, craftsmen, soldiers were deported to Siberia. Some were dragged out of detention cells and shot. In Tallinn some of the atrocities took place in a cellar close to Victory Square. In this building there is currently a fast food outlet, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizza\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Ironic and outrageous! Such commercialization, in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion, is sacrilegious and uncouth, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respect the martyrdom of those who were murdered, and should not be allowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 22 Hitler declared War on USSR and the Baltic States, including Estonia. According to Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plans, Estonia was to be repopulated with Germans and converted into a new Third Reich state stretching as far as Leningrad (St. Petersburg), Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people surrendered to the invading Germans, when the Germans entered Estonia from the South. Not because they wanted to fight against the Nazi system but rather because they calculated that it would be better to surrender and be a prisoner byGermans, rather than die under the Bolsheviks who had sent their relatives to Sakhalin Island concentration camps in Far Eastern Siberia (near Japan).\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers, especially religious figures, welcomed the chance to fight against what they and many of their parishioners viewed as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgodless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Soviet regime. A small number of those connected to religious organizations may have shared some of the views of the Nazis about Jews and other groups.\\r\\nMost of some 4,000 Estonian Jews fled to Russia, some 1000 who did not, were eventually murdered. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy July 12, 1941 Russian-German War boundary line was at Emajogi River which runs through the middle of Tartu, close to our home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of the summer of 1941, Germans occupied the rest of Northern Estonia in a quick military action. However, an expected independence of Estonia did not materialize. On July 29th, Estonian Prime Minister J\\xc3\\xbcri Uluots requested sovereignty for Estonia by presenting a political memorandum to General Kuchler, Commander of the 18th German Army. However, it was in vain, the occupiers had no intention allowing Estonia to become independent. By that time 20,807 Estonian men had been forced to join the German Army to fight the retreating Soviets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 22 USSR tried to evacuate Tallinn. A great sea disaster followed, 53 of 197 ships evacuating Russian soldiers and Estonians (that were forced to go to Russia) were sunk in the Finnish Straight by German warships. An estimated 14,000 persons drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus opened two new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAMRO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (for Amanda and Romulus) stores in Tartu on 77 Star Street, on ground floor of an apartment building owned by grandmother Amalie (Amanda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUncle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Daniel Andreimann (second marriage). One store sold candy and chocolate. The other store sold books (including academic books for Tartu University) and a selection of other books, stationary, leather goods, children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toys, women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accessories, etc. Romulus became very friendly with Tartu University students. He gave them good deals and sold books on credit, to help out students who haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t managed their funds properly. AMRO became the alternate book store to the official university book store. (Even today such an arrangement commonly exists in most university towns of the world).\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was unofficially \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin charge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of testing sweets and toys, and lived in seventh heaven. He was also put sitting on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccash register\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,which consisted of a wooden sloping counter, with a lift top, under which the cash/money was stored. He took this uncomfortable position whenever father went to eat in the apartment behind the store. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYell like hell if anyone tries to lift the top of the lid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When in doubt, at age 4 to 5, Rein often decided to yell out an alarm,  just in case, often to as an entertainment and to the customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein started kindergarten, across Star Street, where a large indoor market stood. He turned right, up Eha Street and across what seemed like a big paved parking lot with many \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trucks and military vehicles driving here and there and everywhere. First looking left and right, as he had been taught, Rein would run as fast as he could for the school building.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our living room corner was a big white porcelain wood burning stove that went to the ceiling. Once heated, it radiated warmth the all day long and was good to nuzzle up to. When you whetted some pieces of paper, and molded it into animals and people, you could dry them on the porcelain to play with. The dining area also had a large round wooden table that served as racetrack for driving tricycles around, especially great for chasing friends with their tricycles, accompanied by appropriate yells and whoops.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of the China cabinet was the model of a large sailboat suited up in billowing sails, put there \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuntil Rein was old enough to play with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That time never came and some Communist looter probably ended up with it. Bastards!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Onhis 50-th birthday Rein finally became the proud owner of his own model sailboat the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeon, A Norwegian Brigantine, 1882 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1915\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, bought by Mari. It was worth the wait and Rein was now almost old enough to play with it.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the bedroom which Rein shared with his parents, in the corner of the room, was a mound of toys from the store that often reached higher that Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s height at the time. Rein had had the wisdom to select the right parents. A particularly favourite toy was a two-storey doll house, that was electrified and you could turn on and off lights in the various rooms. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bed was located so, that right from babyhood, he could see his parents, but he had to crane his head and eyes backward, thereby injuring his eyes which resulted in him having to wear glasses to correct for stigmatism, from an early age.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to the toilet was always a terrifying experience. In a windowless room, just off the main entrance door, was and indoor \\xe2\\x80\\x9couthouse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The hole in which you did your business was in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind humongous. You had to lean forward to balance yourself, because falling backwards was a source of  great terror. Rein was left alone there, once he had been lifted into the appropriate position. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever take long to do one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business. To be rescued you had to bang on the wall with all your might and fear. Once a week the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSibi\\xe2\\x80\\x9d truck came and emptied the \\xe2\\x80\\x9couthouse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d using a long hose that lead to a whining pump that sucked out the contents. (Rein, probably as a result, has all his life been fascinated with the different technologies used to facilitate a very necessary human function in the many countries he has visited).\\r\\n\\r\\nNext door to the indoor \\xe2\\x80\\x9couthouse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was another room without windows that served as the family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s informal eating area. One door lead to the kitchen and the other to the front foyer. This room became the family \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbomb shelter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when the Russians started to bomb Tartu again. Having no windows the room was believed to be safe from shattering glass. The house had no cellar.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein clearly remembers the bright phosphorous Russian parachute bomb that once hung over their house to illuminate it for bombing. We realized that our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbomb shelter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d room would be useless in the case of a direct hit. But nothing happened, we considered ourselves very lucky.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus, like many Estonians during the War, raised rabbits in a shed at the back of the house, because there were periods of time when meat was scarce. A white rabbit, with big red eyes, became Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first pet.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein covered the backyard, between huge woodpiles and the shed, with grooves that became \\xe2\\x80\\x9crailroad tracks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for his various railroad toys. Hide-and-go-seek was popular among the woodpiles. Grandmothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house was next door, the backyards and a joint garden, filled up the remaining space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the opposite side of the garden fence was a high wooden fence separating the house from the neighbour on the other side. Some \\xe2\\x80\\x9cidiot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d used to lurk behind the fence and suddenly appear on top of the fence making scary shouts and yells. Those sudden scares are imprinted in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was eventually allowed to walk, alone, past the University main building, on his own from 77 Tahe Street to 12 Lai Street where his cousins, Mare and Reet Sarap, lived. Salme Sarap was Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sister, married to Aleksander Sarap. She was one of the best female athletes in Estonia (volleyball) and he was one of the few people who played ice hockey semi-professionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trip to Lai Street was always an adventure and took Rein past Tartu University main building with its six large white Corinthian columns. In 1989 a student from Tartu, Estonia, Andres Arrak, studying with Rein in the CIDA-funded \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEast-West Enterprise Exchange Programme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had his father paint a picture of the main University building and it hangs in the living room. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter, Romulus would take Rein to the Saraps\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house, on a wooden sleigh with huge metal runners, mounted to a two-person wooden armchair. Romulus would stand on the back, on the runners and propel/steer the sleigh with his feet. No one plowed the streets, in those days, and sleighs whether human or horse propelled were a common sight in the winter. In the summer bicycles and horse drawn carriages, with the odd motor vehicle, were the means of transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nInter-city travel was by train, which Romulus and Uncle Daniel took often to buy goods for the stores. Because Daniel was born in Russia he made his living as a travelling salesman, buying goods all over Russia for sale in Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Saraps\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house, on Lai Street, Rein lost his belief in Santa Claus. The Saraps lived on the top floor of a house and on one side of the apartment was an attic under the eaves of the roof. Curious Rein snuck into the semi-dark attic and discovered a Santa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suit hanging on a nail. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHEEELP! Somebody has murdered Santa Claus!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second traumatic event occurred in the Sarap house during a family celebration. Rein had told Romulus many times that he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to eat rabbit meat --- a father-son conflict. Romulus told Rein that the dinner that night was chicken. After the meal Romulus teased Rein that he had eaten rabbit and that he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell the difference between rabbit and chicken and as a matter of fact he had liked it. In fact Rein had been fed his own pet white rabbit, the one with the big red eyes. In reaction, Rein threw up on Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lap and all over the dinner table --- chaos followed with everyone joining Rein in throwing up. The dinner party came to sudden end. Romulus was very upset. But Amanda (mother) arose in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cServes you right, Rommu!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eaten rabbit since.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummers were spent at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarkhanse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d farm, apparently owned by grandmother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family. It was an operating dairy farm with many animals and a lot of fields and woods to explore. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first sauna was taken here. In the middle of the farmyard was a huge mound, an underground root cellar, where all the produce was kept over winter. On each side of the cellar there were large barns, one for the grain, one for the animals and one for the hay. Every building was in the exact place as Rein remembered it, when we visited the farm again in 1991 and 2002. Amazing!\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to the farm was by train and then by horse and wagon. The train left Tartu, through Elva, to Puka, the small village station closest to the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\n1942\\r\\nJanuary 26. First American forces arrived in Great Britain. Lectures had started again at the University of Tartu and the Tallinn Polytechnic Institute.\\r\\nMarch 7. Winston Churchill wrote to President Roosevelt and recommended that the Baltic States and part of Finland be recognized as having joined the Soviet Union. Roosevelt advised against any official recognition in this regard, but conceded that neither Britain nor United States is going to drive the Soviet Union out with military force. In the long run, neither Britain nor the USA recognized the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union. Estonian Consulate General in New York City and the Estonian Embassy in London, England were operational up to when re-independence occurred on August 21, 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 3. Major - General Lembit P\\xc3\\xa4rn became the commander of the Red Army 7-th Rifle Division. Estonian soldiers had been divided among the occupying Germans, some Estonian soldiers who reported to Estonian officers hoped to recapture Estonian independence. A large number of these Estonian soldiers were forced to fight the Soviets in Russia, after the Germans captured Estonia in 1941.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 21. Rommel captured Tobruk leading the effective tank forces of the German Afrika Corps. Subsequently his forces reached El Alamein near Cairo.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 24. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed Commander-in-Chief of US forces in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 3. German forces crushed 7 Red Army Divisions on the Leningrad  (St.Petersburg) front, but were unable to capture the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 15 German army surrounded Stalingrad (Volgograd). According to historians a very high percentage of political and military collaboration  was found among citizens of the USSR, with some 1.3 to 1.5 million Soviet citizens serving in German-controlled military units alone. These people were afraid of the random acts and murders by the Bolsheviks. Stalin ordered that the Russian soldiers have to defend the city named in his honour until their death. Eventually a Russian counter attack surrounded the city. The Battle lasted from 23 August 1942 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 February 1943. A total of 1.7\\xe2\\x80\\x932 million soldiers were wounded, killed or captured. It was the largest battle ever fought in a War. Out of the nearly 91,000 Nazi prisoners captured in Stalingrad, only about 5,000 returned home toGermany.\\r\\n\\r\\nHitler also had ordered that the German soldiers must fight until their death, rather than surrender. The German general in charge of the defense of Stalingrad was ironically called von Paulus. He had to eventually surrender the city because of a lack of supplies and ammunition.  On Dec. 13: The Luftwaffe tried unsuccessfully to fly in meagre supplies to the beleaguered Stalingrad troops. It was too late. Nazi forces under von Paulus were severely defeated and General Field Marshal von Paulus was taken prisoner by the Soviets. While in Soviet captivity during the war, Paulus became a vocal critic of the Nazi regime and joined the Soviet-sponsored\\xc2\\xa0National Committee for a Free Germany. He moved to the\\xc2\\xa0German Democratic Republic\\xc2\\xa0(East Germany) in 1953.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 3\\xc2\\xa0Second Battle of El Alamein\\xc2\\xa0ended - German forces under\\xc2\\xa0Erwin Rommel\\xc2\\xa0were forced to retreat during the night by Allied forces lead by UK Field Marshal Montgomery.\\r\\nDec.12: Rommel abandoned El Agheila and retreated to Tripoli. They made a final stand at the Mareth line in southern Tunisia, but were forced to withdraw from Africa to Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the War, Mari lived with her mother Marta in the Estonian embassy in London, where she was the ambassador August Torma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little pet. Torma served as ambassador from 1934-1971. According to English Law the Estonian embassy was to remain open until the last civil servant working at the embassy, who had been appointed during the Estonian Republic, remained alive. They would be welcome to live in the embassy, at British expense, and would also carry diplomatic accreditation. The last accredited person at the embassy was a lady who had served as housekeeper under August Torma. She was alive when we visited the embassy in the second half of the 1970s, a beautiful 4 story mansion at 16 Hyde Park Gate. Mari remembered the drawer in the kitchen where the cook kept the candy for the children and the drawer still smelled from \\xe2\\x80\\x9csweets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. After the lady died the embassy reverted to the British Government and was restored to the Estonian government upon re-independence in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Estonian Consulate General in Washington , where Consul-General Ernst Jaakson (was in office 1965-1991), became the de facto spokesman for Estonians-in \\xe2\\x80\\x93Exile. In 1991 the Consulate-General immediately became an integral part of the re-established Estonian foreign service. Ernst Jaakson was appointed as the Estonian ambassador to the USA and to the United Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter re-independence, in August, 1992, the new Estonian government recognised the Government-in-Exile. The last Acting President-in-Exile Heinrich Mark was officially invited to Tallinn to address Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu). On October 8, 1992 Mark \\xe2\\x80\\x98handed over the creditentials\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the Government-in\\xe2\\x80\\x93Exile to the newly elected Estonian President Lennart Meri. From his side Meri issued a statement expressing the gratitude to Mark and the Government-in-Exile for \\xe2\\x80\\x98keeping the legal continuity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the Estonian state, by preserving a continuous line of heads of state from President P\\xc3\\xa4ts (1940) to President Meri (1991).\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now clear that a Government-in-Exile can only preserve national symbols, but was unable to restore itself to national power. This had been the dream of many involved in the politics of the Estonians in exile. The first edition of the Toronto Estonian Newspaper, after re-independence (1991) carried the headline: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat Is Going To Happen To Us Now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The exile community in Toronto felt disenfranchised from their dream of some day \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberating Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n1943\\r\\nFebruary 2. Germans surrendered at Stalingrad, the beginning of the end of Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambitions and armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 13. An unsuccessful attempt was made to assassinate Hitler by German officers who thought that he was becoming de-ranged \\xe2\\x80\\x93 several weeks later another unsuccessful attempt was made in Berlin. Both were unsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 3. All Estonian men born in 1925 were ordered to report to the Nazi State Labour Service recruitment office, 12,849 Estonians had already served in the German army.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 8 Allies signed armistice with Mussolini\\xe2\\x80\\x99s armies in Italy. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough initially the Germans were perceived by most Estonians as liberators from the USSR and its repressions, and hopes were raised for the restoration of the country\\'s independence, it was soon realized that they were but another occupying power. The Germans pillaged the country for the war effort and unleashed the Holocaust. For the duration of the occupation Estonia was incorporated into a German province of Ostland.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 3. Soviet Union published a propaganda flyer \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhyWe are Fighting for a Soviet Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It contains 362 signatures of Estonian officers serving in the Red Army. A week later the Germans organized a protest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby the entire Estonian labour force\\xe2\\x80\\x9d against Stalin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise to liberate Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 9. A total of 2,000 Estonians volunteered to serve in the Finnish armed forces.\\r\\n\\r\\n1944\\r\\nJanuary 27. The 900 day siege of Leningrad ended. Citizens of nearby Estonian city Narva were evacuated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 1 Russian armies arrived and tried to cross at Estonian borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 7. On radio the last Estonian President J\\xc3\\xbcri Uluots, ordered mobilization in Estonia. By February 16 there were 28,500 men mobilized in Estonian barracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 2 Battle for the Narva Bridgehead took place.The Soviet 8th Army launched the initial attack of the Narva Offensive . The 44th German Infantry Regiment and the 1st Estonian Regiment\\xc2\\xa0repulsed it\\xc2\\xa0inflicting heavy losses to the Soviets. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe III SS Panzer Corps were then evacuated from Narva and the front was settled on the final defensive standoff , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Tannenberg Line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which included the\\xc2\\xa0Sinim\\xc3\\xa4e Hills\\xc2\\xa0by July 26. Twenty-four volunteer infantry battalions from\\xc2\\xa0Denmark, East Prussia,\\xc2\\xa0Flanders,\\xc2\\xa0the Netherlands,\\xc2\\xa0Norway, and\\xc2\\xa0Wallonia\\xc2\\xa0participated with the\\xc2\\xa0Waffen-SS. Roughly half of the infantry consisted of local\\xc2\\xa0Estonian conscripts\\xc2\\xa0motivated to regain Estonian independence rather than support Nazi power.\\xc2\\xa0The German force of 22,250 men held off 136,830 Soviet troops. As the Soviet forces were constantly reinforced, their casualties were eventually an enormous 170,000 dead and wounded, and 160 tanks destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviets were never able to actually conquer the Sinim\\xc3\\xa4e hills in World War II. The German and other forces organized a successful retreat to Southwest Estonia. The Sinim\\xc3\\xa4e battles were the most bloody battles ever held on Estonian soil and lasted from July 25 to August 10, 1944. The war for Estonia was now mostly over and the Soviets ultimately conquered the country. This Battle sent a clear message to Romulus that he and the family must escape from Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, the Soviet Air Force had also undertaken terror bombing attacks of Estonian cities: March 6th on Narva (the city was nearly destroyed); March 9th on Tallinn (750 residents killed, 5073 buildings destroyed); March 26th Tartu (130 residents killed). \\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 22. Elderly Estonian hero, Admiral Pitka had returned from Finland to try and help organize the defense of Estonia. Pitka organized a volunteer military group in Estonia and fought several hopeless battles against Soviet forces and was killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy January the war in Europe had changed dramatically. The Allied armies had met with success after success against the Germans. The U-boats were defeated. Western Powers had control of the air space over the Reich, sending in thousand plane bombing raids by day and by night. German forces had been badly defeated in Russia and in the Mediterranean (Rommel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Afrika Korps) with over a million men killed in the previous year. The Wehrmacht had depleted its resources fighting the invasion in the Mediterranean, Italy had collapsed and Hitler had been forced to place as many divisions in Southern Europe as he had in the West. \\r\\nNazi Germany, however, was still far from accepting defeat. The Germans had been driven back by the Red Army from the Volga to the Dnieper, but, the Soviet forces were stalled five hundred miles from the German border. In Italy the Allied advance had been brought to a halt by terrain and fierce resistance from the Wehrmacht and the Nazis still held the western coast of Europe, daily strengthening their defensive forces on the Atlantic Wall. The output of the German armament industry was at an unprecedented high level and there were rumours of new weapons being developed shortly, such as jet-propelled aircraft and even possibly an atomic bomb. (After the War the Allies discovered that Germany had been 6 to 12 months from developing new weapons that could have won the War for Germany \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but Hitler was an impatient dictator and incompetent as a military strategist).\\r\\nJune 6 Allied landings ocurred in Normandy, France, the begging of the end of Nazi occupation of Europe had started.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 20 Failed plots were the culmination of the efforts of the German Resistance to overthrow the Nazi regime. The failure of both the assassination and the military coup d\\'\\xc3\\xa9tat, which was planned to follow it, led to the arrest of at least 7,000 people by the Gestapo  According to records of the F\\xc3\\xbchrer Conferences on Naval Affairs 4,980 people were executed, resulting in the destruction of the complete resistance movement in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July, Rein, Daniel and Amalie stayed at Markhanse, (our family) farm to escape the bombing of Tartu. Amanda was pregnant with T\\xc3\\xb5nu and had been sent to the best hospital in Tallinn, the capital. It was expected that she would receive proper care and be safe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin the capital which would fall lastly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the war already raging in the South.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus attempted to reach Tallinn by rail to bring Amanda to Southern Estonia. He bribed a railway engineer to drive his engine (with no wagons or tender) to Tallinn. They reached Lagendi station (15 kilometers from the Tallinn Main \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBaltic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Station) and had to retreat back to Tartu because of the raging war. Rumour had it that Romulus not only bribed the engineer, but also threatened him with a revolver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 11 Hitler ordered the deportation of 4,500 Jews from Estonia to concentration camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 24 Tank battle occurred near Elva in Southern Estonia where the family Markhanse Farm and the Petersons were located.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 25 Russian army captured Estonia up to a line just North of Tartu, on the North side Ema River that runs through the middle of Tartu.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 25 Allies liberated Paris, France.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 1 Canadian troops captured\\xc2\\xa0Dieppe, France.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 5 Canadian troops crossed the border into the Netherlands.    \\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 6 Amanda gave birth to T\\xc3\\xb5nu in Tallinn at the best hospital in the capital of Estonia. Subsequently she refused to accept help from a friend of Romulus to escape from Tallinn to Germany by boat, because she thinks T\\xc3\\xb5nu is too young to travel. There is some controversy as to what exactly happened and was said. According to the friend, Amanda refused help, it was reported that she insisted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRommu\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nick-name) would come and save her. At that time Romulus was unaware of T\\xc3\\xb5nu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 8\\xc2\\xa0Brest, France, an important Channel port, falls to the Allies. \\r\\nSept. 10\\xc2\\xa0Luxembourg\\xc2\\xa0was liberated by U.S. First Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Allied forces met at\\xc2\\xa0Dijon, cutting France in half.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinland signed a non-aggression armistice with the USSR.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept.15 Russians broke through German/Estonian defenses at Narva and ultimately cutting Estonia in two, separating German and Estonian forces in North, around Tallinn. In the South the German/Estonian front line ran just North of a corridor running between Tartu-P\\xc3\\xa4rnu.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept.16 The second Soviet occupation effectively commenced when the Germans announced that they would be withdrawing from Estonia. There had been heavy fighting at Sinim\\xc3\\xa4e Hills, outside Tallinn, and elsewhere, occasionally placed Estonians in German and Estonians in Soviet units fighting against each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept.17 The Red Army began its attack across the Emaj\\xc3\\xb5gi River that runs through Tartu. A number of soldiers in the Estonian Rifle Corps, controlled by Russian officers, refused to cross the river and were summarily executed. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the evening of September 18, despite energetic resistance by the Estonian units and whatever Germans were left, the Red Army had broken through the line at Emaj\\xc3\\xb5gi and into the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccultural heart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Estonia, Tartu, the second largest city in Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 18 German forces started to abandon their military positions and flee. German and Estonian forces in disarray, withdrew further South, towards Latvia, and the port of P\\xc3\\xa4rnu. \\r\\n\\r\\nJ\\xc3\\xbcri Uluots proclaimed a\\xc2\\xa0Government of Estonia\\xc2\\xa0headed by Deputy Prime Minister\\xc2\\xa0Otto Tief.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 20 The Government of Estonia seized the government buildings on\\xc2\\xa0Toompea\\xc2\\xa0from the German forces and appealed to the Soviet Union to grant independence to Estonia.  The appeal was ignored.\\r\\nTogether with the return of Soviet control came a wave of robbery, looting, rape and killing. With the Red Army also came the political police, the NKVD. Deportations followed, Soviet Estonian radio reporting 30,000 deported by late 1944. Many men took to the forest to fight a partisan war. These \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrothers of the Forest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Metsavennad) carried on a guerilla war which eventually, incredibly, on one scale or another, lasted until the 1970\\'s, when the last Estonian guerilla surrendered (by committing suicide). \\r\\nThe year 1944 ended in tragedy for the Estonians but as a result of the dogged bravery exhibited by Estonian soldiers, as German forces withdrew, close to 90,000 people managed to eventually escape to the West.\\r\\nBut in September, 1944, the destination of our own journey was very unclear. We wanted to stay free. We thought that we would eventually recognize a Promised Land, as we did more than six years later --- in Canada. Our immediate need was to survive. Life became an arduous, continuous journey, one day at a time. \\r\\nRomulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision to escape to Germany was dangerous. Paris had been reconquered from the Germans by the Allies and German forces were in retreat because of Allied forces that had landed during D day farther North.\\r\\nSept. 21Aachen\\xc2\\xa0was occupied by U.S. First Army and it was the first major German city to be captured by the Allies.\\r\\nRomulus, Daniel, Amalie and Rein escaped from the Markhanse farm via back country roads towards Parnu. A woman, Rein clearly remembers, with a prosthetic arm, drove the horses and wagon through the chaos of retreating German and Estonian forces. We reached eventually the small safe town called K\\xc3\\xb5pu. Subsequently we arrived in P\\xc3\\xa4rnu, during a firestorm and bombing; approaching Russian forces could be seen on the horizon. We abandoned most of our suitcases and belongings \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin trust\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with locals (whom Romulus bribed) and who promised to keep them safe, in a shed, until we return. This was expected to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplete panic and disorder in P\\xc3\\xa4rnu, as everyone was trying to escape the approaching Russian armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo German warships were left in harbour, secretly transporting ammunition in their holds, one of which was eventually sunk by a submarine upon leaving port; luckily we chose the other ship. Romulus in an Arbeitsbattalion (German work battalion) uniform was allowed to evacuate/board with his family, because Germans needed manpower in their factories (and possibly as more soldier/fodder for the Russian front). \\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus had served in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKindral Inspektuur\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, the German/Estonian armed forces agency that was responsible for maintaining armed forces discipline. The work of this office was highly secret, since a number of soldiers were either shot or jailed after being found guilty of desertion or in violation of orders.  Romulus had served as typist, typing the orders for execution and jailing of individual soldiers. Retribution from Germans, Estonians or Russians was clearly a possibility. As a result Romulus was assigned, by a friendly Estonian General commanding the office, to the Arbeitsbattalion uniform, so that he could possibly escape with his family on a German evacuation ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to historical records, researched by Rein, Johannes Soodla was the SS-Brigadef\\xc3\\xbchrer, Inspector-General, of the Estonians units in German Armed Forces at the end of the Estonian War. Prior to this Soodla had headed both the Estonian police and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOmakaitse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a paramilitary self defence organization during the German occupation. He also escaped and was seen in post-war refugee camps in Germany. He was clearly a good man to whom Rein and Romulus owed their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 23, our German escape ship, loaded with ammunition below decks, and with a large number of escaping German soldiers and refugees on the deck, clearly overloaded, the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpochet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d battleship, silently slipped/limped out of P\\xc3\\xa4rnu harbour at night for K\\xc3\\xb5ningsberg (now Kaliningrad). Russian planes were seen strafing and bombing ships on the Baltic Sea and a submarine sunk our sister ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 24 Russian armies enter P\\xc3\\xa4rnu.  An estimated 70 to 90,000 Estonians escaped to Finland, Sweden and Germany in boats. Many who left in unsuitable boats, died on the stormy Baltic Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 25 We arrived by the navy boat in K\\xc3\\xb5nigsberg, East Prussia. Before German authorities could detain him, Romulus jumped from the ship and escaped into the darkness. He was afraid to be caught and pressed into labour camps or sent to the Russian front, because he was wearing an Arbeitsbattalion uniform. He recalled running through the dark, falling over hedges, and over the railway tracks. Eventually he was able to burn his identification documents and flatten all the identification on his uniform under the wheels of passing trains. In this way they could not be read. He eventually obtained civilian clothes from a good Samaritan.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, sometime in September/October, in Tallinn, Amanda pushed a baby carriage with infant T\\xc3\\xb5nu, and all her remaining belongings, through the remnants of the war zone, from Tallinn to Tartu, along the only one main highway (183 kilometers), which was filled with military vehicles, many of which were on fire. She had no money, knew some people in Tartu, but none in Tallinn. Infant T\\xc3\\xb5nu became ill. Eventually this became a serious disease in his left leg, a type of Polio,that destroyed the marrow inside the right leg/hip bone. T\\xc3\\xb5nu required, subsequently, many operations over a period of the next 2 to 3 years. Arriving in Tartu, Tonu was admitted into the hospital and Amanda, having no place to stay, was allowed to sleep under T\\xc3\\xb5nu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bed. As the wife of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccapitalist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shopkeeper, and therefore hated by the Communists, she would have been classified as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccriminal petit bourgeois\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and subject to deportation to Siberia. Therefore she could not go to the house and stores owned by Romulus and Amanda to retrieve any personal effects. She also had no working skills, aside from having helped the sales girls in Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 store. The stores and apartment house were pillaged and confiscated to become government property. \\r\\n\\r\\n(In 1989, still during Soviet occupation time, Rein visited the building. Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 store had been turned into the local police station. One aged female was living alone in our apartment, therefore breaking Soviet law, because of having too many square meters of living space allocated to her alone. Apparently she had not reported the deaths of her family members to the housing bureau. She was terrified, but allowed Rein to look at our former home that had not apparently received any maintenance in 44 years. After Estonian re-independence in 1991 Amanda, as the heir of grandmother Amalie, was able to get reparations for the building, and sold her share and thereby bought a small condominium apartment in Tartu).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK TWO: ESCAPE\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who dream by day are cognizant of many things that escape those who dream only by night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn arriving in K\\xc3\\xb5ningsberg (Kaliningrad), on the last German Pochet Battle ship, Rein, Romulus and grandparents started a 51 month escape/adventure on September 21, 1944 to January 1, 1949. It took Romulus and Rein to Canada via the following escape route: Tartu \\xe2\\x80\\x93Markhanse -- Puka/Elva \\xe2\\x80\\x93 K\\xc3\\xb5pu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Parnu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 K\\xc3\\xb5ningsberg \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Danzig \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Stettin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Grunau (near Frankfurt am Oder) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Dresden \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Chemnitz \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Plauen -- N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Leipzig -- Weilheim (South of M\\xc3\\xbcnchen) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Augsburg \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Geislingen (Steige) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Aachen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Charleroi, Belgium \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Aachen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Geislingen (Steige) \\xe2\\x80\\x93Stuttgart/Ludwigshafen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bremenhaven \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Halifax \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Toronto -- Orillia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Montreal. \\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel and Amalie ended up being allowed to immigrate to Seabrook, New Jersey, USA, as farm labourers on a farm that grew and packed frozen vegetables. Rein and Romulus were denied entry into the U.S. The clerk told us that was no such category as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSingle man with young child\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for immigration into the U.S. A similar Canadian clerk said that it was nonsense and stamped our application ADMITTED.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also the beginning of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inner journey. He needed to grow up instantly; a childhood cut short; learning how to survive cleverly (under his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tuteledge) in a world that was filled with both friendly and unfriendly adults, on whom we depended for our survival. As a young boy of 8, Rein was given no choice, of course. It was also the time of religious awakening for Rein. Praying daily for his mother, he became aware of God.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I was a child, I spoke and saw things as a child.\\r\\nWhen I grew up, I had finished with childish things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t--- St. Paul\\r\\n\\r\\nRein believes that we have been put on this earth to learn and to be tested, and to strengthen our inner self. More on this later, but by 1945, I was not afraid of being tested by the future, in the chaos around us. My father and I adopted a philosophy of living fully, one day at a time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a philosophy Rein has tried to practice every day since. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop ocean waves \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 but you learn how to surf.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nOn September 25, 1945, after jumping ship in K\\xc3\\xb5ningsberg, Romulus managed to keep track of Rein and the grandparents, who ran from German refugee camp to German refugee camp. Rein started to meet Romulus in various dark (scary) shadowy places. Rein stole cigarettes for Romulus. Romulus returned the favour by supplying him with candy during their meetings. Why he could not also steal cigarettes?\\r\\n                  \\r\\nWe escaped by trains which were continually being strafed and bombed by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllied\\xe2\\x80\\x9d airplanes. We headed towards Danzig (Gadansk) along with other refugees, then towards Stettin (Szczean) on the German \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Polish border at the Elbe River and then South, along the Elbe towards Bavaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recollections come from a German refugee camp, in the small village of Grunau (just south of the city of Fankfurt am der Oder, which in turn was only 60 kilometers East of Berlin). Every night there were many bombing raids on Berlin and Frankfurt and we spent a lot of time running downstairs to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cair raid center\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the cellar. The camp included mostly refugees from Latvia. Rein, having lived on the Latvian border in Estonia, convinced the German authorities that he could translate from Latvian to German and vice versa, for appropriate treats (and possibly cigarettes). There is still doubt in his own mind about how much Latvian or German he ractuallly spoke at the time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but apparently it was a good gig. \\r\\nRein does know that his daughter Jennifer-Mai Charlotte is a whiz at learning languages. Backward analysis, via Genes, to father and/ or mother, would explain this?\\r\\n\\r\\nFood was very scarce for everyone and what was available was not very nutritious. Rein remembers the first time that the camp was able to cook (nutritious) soup from potato peels.The children had been told to barter/beg/steal from local Germans their potato peels. This we did with na\\xc3\\xafve enthusiasm. WOW! The ladies cooked up a magnificient potato peel soup. It was the best food we had eaten after a long period of near starvation. Potatoes remain a favourite food for Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntense bombing continued nightly --- Rein is/was proud to be able to run, fast, from a dead sleep, jumping down from a third tier bunk bed, to the air raid shelter in the basement. It became a game. Can I beat my last time? As soon as the air raid siren sounded the alarm. This happened several times a night and may have been the beginning of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subsequent (track career?).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the cellar of the building we were terrified that some idiot \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pilot may decide to drop his bombs on our defenseless small village. The pilots did this to escape having to face German aircraft fire over Frankfurt am Elbe or Berlin. Such arbitrary dropping of bombs was corroborated after the War. In one hilarious/sad case, refugees had run scared to the cellar to be faced with an unexploded shell that had pierced their roof, and directly fallen to the cellar. There it was staring at them. Reverse!\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to steal cigarettes. By walking down some agreed upon dark street, Romulus would suddenly grasp Rein by the scruff of his neck, from behind some tree or bush, and exchange candy for cigarettes. Scary stuff! Where Romulus got the sweets has remained a mystery. Rein also collected half smoked cigarette butts from the ground. Romulus would retrieve the tobacco from the butts and roll cigarettes of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere along the way, Rein remembers the following incident. He was passing by an officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 club on some street. A full package of cigarettes was lying in the middle of the street. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice a fine string tied to the package, that went behind the hedge in front of the Officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Club. When Rein went to pick up the package the soldiers behind the hedge pulled the string and the full package of cigarettes repeatedly escaped Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grasp. After several repeats of this process (and upon laughter behind the hedge), Rein caught on, deeply embarrassed, that he was being made a fool of. He became angry angry and picked up sizeable rock and heaved it towards the hedge. Unfortunately the rock went through the hedge and the front window of the house/officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Club. Apparently the officers near the window thought that the rock was a grenade and pandemonium broke out. The soldiers (on their knees) behind the hedge were discovered by officers and there were a lot of loud orders shouted here and there. Rein ran for his life, a little surprised at his act, to this day. The next time Rein, carefully, passed the Officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Club, an officer came out and gave Rein a full package of cigarettes. Truce? \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Grunau, Rein had a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctonsils\\xe2\\x80\\x9d operation, without antiseptic, and instead of stitches a sanitized safety pin was used to close the wound under the chin. Not much fun. A scar under the chin has been a constant souvenir reminder.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually Romulus came out of hiding and joined Rein. We started to travel separately from Daniel and Amalia. We had no money. To get transport on trains, which amazingly ran on time, Rein learned to fake crying fits, like most young children. He would do this beside the door of a first class rail wagon. The curtains were usually parted by some kind lady, at which time my father would show himself from the shadows. There were an amazing number of kind and wealthy German \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctantes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (ladies) on the trains at that time. Rein had to sleep in their laps among large bosoms of these grand \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmamas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. What a way to travel first class!\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus slept in the overhead baggage racks, hidden by coats and blankets, when the conductor came looking for tickets. That was our method of first class travel during the War, for free. Necessity was the mother of invention.\\r\\n\\r\\n1945\\r\\nJanuary 16, a Certificate of Naturalization was issued to Karl Aleksander Paulus, by the Chief Registrar, Accra, Gold Coast, a British Colony, in Africa. His address was given as South Banket Areas Limited, P.O. Box 100, Tarkwa, Gold Coast, therby giving him legal status in the U.K.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 19, just ahead of us, Russian tanks entered Lodz, Poland. Russian General Konev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army crossed the German pre-war border. War on German soil had started.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 25 Hitler renamed the army groups that had escaped South from Estonia, now trapped in Livonia/Latvia, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArmy Group Courland\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. They were the remnants of the German and Estonian armies, plus refugees, who had been pushed out of Estonia and Latvia. They stayed trapped there until the end of the War. Then, most of then were captured and sent to Siberia or killed by the Soviet Army. We always wondered whether any members of our families were trapped there along with the soldiers in the cul-de-sac.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 31, the Soviet armies reached the Oder River (30 kilometers from Dresden) and halted. Later we discovered that there was an argument between two Soviet Generals and Josef Stalin, as to who should be allowed to capture Berlin first (seen as a great honour).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the bombing, most German civilians and refugees knew that the war was over. Most able bodied men were dead or missing and the anti-aircraft \\xe2\\x80\\x9cack-ack guns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were supposedly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmanned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by young teen-aged school boys, the wounded and retired people, trying to save their beautiful city. The bombing was an unnecessary act of inhumanity championed by one man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambitions, perhaps to appease Russian vengeance against ordinary German people. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Red Cross had been assured by the Allies that they would not bomb Dresden, where it was known that an estimated 35,000 refugees were congregated, including us. We, and all refugees, were treated well by the German, non-military, non-Nazi population of Dresden. They felt themselves as insecure as we did, but shared as much as they could their food and hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 13 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 15 The first two bombings of Dresden resulted in an out of control hurricane force wind, inferno, right in the centre of the city. There were fires everywhere with a terrific concentration in the centre of the city. The intense heat and smoke obliterated any ability for the third and last wave of American bombers to see their supposed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmilitary targets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. They released their bomb loads blindly, over residential areas. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in Dresden, Rein and Romulus were lucky to survive the brutal \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarpet bombing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the United States, British and French. We survived the downtown inferno while hiding with other refugees in the underground of the Dresden Hauptbanhof (main) railway station. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945\\xe2\\x80\\x93 twice by the RAF in a 1,400 plane operation on Tuesday night, that started the assault rolling, and then again by Britain-based bombers of the (American) 8-th Air Force, which staged a 2,250 plane daylight follow-up. That was a total of 3,650 bombers that had been sent. This amounted to 50 civilians killed per bomber.  No wonder that they could bomb Dresden in the daylight, most of the school-boys who had manned anti-aircraft guns probably had been killed, even if they ever had been a threat to experienced bombers. Allied pilots reported no German fighter planes left in the area, to defend Dresden. \\r\\nAccording to calculations by the British historian\\xc2\\xa0David Irving\\xc2\\xa0the total amount of bombs dropped on Dresden was 650,000 tons (fire bombs). The Allies used the first generation of incendiary petroleum bombs which caused massive fire storms. The fires were so intense that people standing in the street were sucked into the burning buildings. David Irving concluded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere have been accounts of up to 350,000 victims of the bombing of\\xc2\\xa0Dresden. This would be the single most devastating war crime atrocity of World War II.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Irving\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estimate of victims was probably an overestimate. The fact is that no one knows how many refugees, fleeing the Russian troops, ever reached Dresden.\\r\\nA Pathfinder pilot was reported as saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as one part of the city was alight, the bombers went for another, until the whole of Dresden was ablaze. RAF crews reported smoke rising to a height of 15,000 ft. from the centre of the city. There were fires everywhere with a terrific concentration in the centre of the city. We faced very little anti-aircraft fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nA total of 220,000 civilians (some controversy over the number exists) were killed which means that it was the greatest man-caused massacre of all times (by comparison 71,379 people were killed by the atom bombs dropped by Americans on Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Rein and Mari visited the site of  the atom bombing in 2008. Brutality, clearly lies below the thin skin of most humans, everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dresden slaughter was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief RAF Bomber Command Arthur \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMad Bomber\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harris. He decided that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbombing of Dresden would break the will of the German people, who would decide not to support Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Historians have branded Harris\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas a self-serving misadventure that resulted in a huge number of civilian casualties (including thousands of refugees) and totally destroyed one of the great cultural-historical-architectural cities in the world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Harris was reported as saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as being worth the bones of one British Grenadier.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nRussian armies were only 60 kilometers from Berlin, just 20 kilometers on the other side of the Oder River, close to the city on which Dresden stood. The War for all intents and purposes was over, especially for the refugees and local citizens. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMad Bomber\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harris committed this butchery while sitting, safely, on his butt in London, far from the reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has also been reported that Harris ran out of unbombed industrial sites and therefore chose Dresden as his last bombing site.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the War Harris insisted that they build a statue for him in London. An RAF Bomber Veterans\\' organization, formed to defend the good name of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctheir commander\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, erected a statue of him outside the RAF Church of\\xc2\\xa0St. Clement Danes, London, in 1992. It was unveiled by\\xc2\\xa0Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, looked surprised when she was jeered by protesters, one of whom shouted, \"Harris is a war criminal!\" \\r\\n\\r\\nUndeserving Harris was also awarded the American\\xc2\\xa0Legion of Merit, Distinguished Service Medal\\xc2\\xa0of the United States, the Polish\\xc2\\xa0Order of Polonia Restituta\\xc2\\xa0First Class, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross\\xc2\\xa0of\\xc2\\xa0Brazil, Russian Order of Suvarov First Class, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath\\xc2\\xa0in UK and was promoted to\\xc2\\xa0Marshal of the Royal Air Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no justice, nor ethics in war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundeserving\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bomber Command crews were denied a separate campaign medal (despite being eligible for the\\xc2\\xa0Air Crew Europe Star\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0France Star and Germany Star). In protest at this establishment snub to his men, Harris refused a\\xc2\\xa0peerage\\xc2\\xa0in 1946; he was the sole commander-in-chief not to become a peer. The many honours reportedly did inflate his ego.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill eventually admitted that Dresden had been a civilian town without military significance. It had no material role of any sort to play in the closing months of the war. So, what strategic purpose did the burning and killing of men, women, old people, refugees and children serve? Churchill himself later wrote that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nAmerican novelist Kurt Vonnegut, who died in 2007, was a prisoner-of-war in Dresden at the time. In the days following the raid on Dresden, Vonnegut and his fellow P-O-Ws were put to work in the city, collecting bodies for burial, after the bombing, while German citizens swore and threw stones at them. Eventually, wrote Vonnegut, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were too many corpses to bury. So instead the Germans sent in troops with flamethrowers. All theses civilians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 corpses were burned to ashes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Vonnegut\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiences in Dresden formed the backdrop of much of his writings, including his most famous novel, Slaughterhouse-Five.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixty years later in 2005, James Skidmore, a professor of German Studies at the University of Waterloo, writing in The Toronto Globe & Mail justified the bombing of Dresden as follows: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The death toll was huge: not 100,000, a figure based on discredited research \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 but between 25,000 and 40,000 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Dresden was a \\xe2\\x80\\x98valid target\\xe2\\x80\\x99. It was an industrial centre. Its train station served as a transportation nexus for troops and materiel destined for the Eastern Front, as well as cattle cars bound for Auschwitz\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Ironically, the bombing brought refief to the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s few remaining Jews \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been ordered to assemble for deportation on Feb. 16. The bombing ended those plans\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Note by Rein: Nonesense! Auschwitz was in southern Poland, near Cracow, which had been captured by the Russians before Feb. 16, some time in January, 1945).\\r\\n\\r\\nSkidmore, Professor of German Studies, himself, had no direct personal contact or knowledge of the Dresden firestorm. He also conjured up a journalistic lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Feb. 12, 2005 Doug Saunders, never in the War, also writing in the Globe & Mail, in an article headed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLessons of  Dresden are Much Misremembered\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reported as follows:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 People in the civilian world had not been told at that point that as many as 100,000 people, mostly cowering women and children, were very deliberately burned to death in bomb-fed storms of flame that eliminated an entire German city\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We were not been told that Dresden was targeted precisely because it had no major military targets, and therefore had not been bombed before, and that it was packed with civilian refugees (Germans and others). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe chief goal of the operation was to create so much horror that civilians would be demoralized\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 This was the deliberate, mass killing of civilians.  Some soldiers might also die, but that would be a lucky accident.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comment: The refugees had headed for Dresden, including us, because of allied propaganda that promised that Dresden, as a city filled with refugees was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworld cultural monument\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and would not be bombed. We served as the cannon fodder for 5,000 for unengaged pilots and their commanders.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, it has turned out that when the Allies had met at the Yalta Conference, before the bombing, on February 4, 1945. The Allies were trying to appease the Russians, who were understandably especially vengeful against the Nazi Germans. They all agreed to grant permission to The Allied Bomber Command to bomb Dresden. \\r\\n\\r\\nConcessions made to Stalin, at Yalta, included other crimes against the defenseless:\\r\\n\\r\\n** Poland was turned over to the Soviet Union. The United States and Britain agreed to recognize Communist stooges as the new Polish government and to withdraw recognition from the legitimate anti-Communist government of Stanislaw Mikolajczyk.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Germany was to be dismembered, its \"national wealth\" removed within two years, and several million Germans were to be sent to the Soviet Union to work as slave labourers. The record quotes Roosevelt as saying, \"I hope Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German army.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n** All Russian citizens who had fled to Germany from Communism were to be forcibly returned to the Soviet Union (i.e., the gulag).\\r\\n\\r\\n** The Soviet Union was given three votes in the United Nations, while all other nations got only one.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 31, 2007, The Financial Post once again rehashed the bombing of Dresden because former Canadian Dresden bombers, at some get-together, were upset about not being honoured in the written history of the Second World War. The Post reported that: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Canadian War Museum in Ottawa has decided to \\xe2\\x80\\x98adjust\\xe2\\x80\\x99 its plaque about Bomber Command during the Second World War in response to veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complaints \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the offending plaque said the following: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe value and morality of strategic bomber offensive against Germany remains bitterly contested. Bomber Command\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aim was to crush civilian morale and force Germany to surrender by destroying its cities and industrial installations\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the raids resulted in only small reductions of German war production until late in the war\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Most of the Bomber Command was made up of British and Canadian pilots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial statistics put the German civilian deaths at 593, 000 (220, 000 of which were in Dresden alone). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCivilians were burned, boiled, crushed an asphyxiated. Most died cowering in cellars, most were women and children or old men (and refugees).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was MURDER. This was a War crime, by the Allies, that has gone unpunished! \\r\\n\\r\\nWriting this many years later, the Dresden bombing, reminds one of the bombing fiascos in Japan, Vietnam, Iraq, London, etc. The military \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgeniuses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d have learned nothing from their past debacles. The bastards just enjoy playing with their lethal toys and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give a damn about the civilian casualties (calling them cynically as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccollateral damage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The bombing of civilians of course frightens civilians, but they also become very angry and resistant to those who abused them. After all what can we expect them to do after we have destroyed their homes, families and everything that they held dear in their lives. Hitler knew that more than 50% of Germans were anti-Nazis. Sometimes, like in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, they have struck back successfully. But the Allies kept on bombing? \\r\\n\\r\\nMany Germans did not like the Nazis \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but this didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that they considered the so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as their friends. Many still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. There are in fact very few good guys in any War.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisiting Dresden on October 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 18, 2006 Rein was able to determine how he and Romulus had survived the fire bombing of the Dresden Hauptbahnhof. The historians have got the story wrong. The Hauptbanhof never received a direct hit by a bomb. The center of the firestorm was several kilometers away, downtown. Shock waves did blow out all the glass/plastic windows and roofs covering the station\\xe2\\x80\\x99s I-Beam arches. Some people, in the station\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basement, were able to escape quickly, so as not to be asphyxiated. Romulus, carried Rein out from the underground wrapped in his overcoat and protected, by throwing him over his shoulder, like a sack of potatoes. He later explained that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were too young to witness the carnage, of people, cut in half, hanging from various beams and the like\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people, including Romulus and Rein, were lucky to be evacuated via make-shift \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork train\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wagons, that braved the holocaust and speeded South to Bavaria with their human cargoes. It is still surprising how \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregularly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d German trains operated right until the end of the War. There were many dedicated professional trainmen doing an incredibly brave job, to provide mobility for those in flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nCase in point is a memory of a sudden air raid on a German railway station. We ran to a train that was speeding out of the station, to take cover in a nearby wooden area, hard to see by strafing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllied\\xe2\\x80\\x9d airplanes. We had left all our belongings on the train station platform, which received extensive damage. Upon our return to the station we discovered that a railway employee had loaded all our belongings onto a railway wagon and pushed it into a vault type, bomb-proof metal container. Such containers were common in areas subject to air raids. We never found out who this good person was. Otherwise we would have been totally without any personal effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy October 17 -18, 2006, when Rein and Mari revisited the City of Dresden, it had been rebuilt according to its pre-war architectural plans that had been prepared several years before to safeguard the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cultural monuments. Frauenkirche, the world heritage church was almost totally rebuilt, using in part, many of the bricks, that had been dislodged, because of the Allied bombings, as a reminder.  Dresden had reached its pre-war status as Germany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKultuur Stadt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great Cultural masterpieces). We saw a similar miracle in Warsaw, where the whole ancient Jewish Ghetto, had been rebuilt to reflect what had been blown up, after the transport of the helpless victims to concentration camps by the Nazis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 25, 1945 The American armies crossed the Rhine River and headed towards Southern Germany and as did Rein and Romulus. The Rhine spelled in German as Rhine (also spelled Rhein, Rin, Rjin, etc.), has probably been the source of the Estonianization of the German word. Rein is similar to the old fashioned word for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It also refers to the pure German high quality beer recipe Reinheitsgebot. Rein faced several years of teasing among German boys, who transalated his name to be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPure Son of Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which could then be abused by profanities. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 3, 1945 On the German border, approximately 60 to 80 kilometers East of  Berlin,  Russian Marshal Zhukov had 768,100 men  waiting to attack Berlin along a 44 kilometer-long bridgehead, West of Kustrin (Kostryn), on the east side of the Oder River in Poland. This was too close to our tight escape route South through Stettin, and many scary rumours floated among us refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second group lead by Russian Marshal Koniev had 511,700 men waiting to attack Berlin from the South, across the Neisse, 75 miles from Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nA third group lead by Russian Marshal Rokossovski had 314,000 men waiting to attack Berlin from the North, 50 kilometers away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 3 Russian armies were positioned just east of Dresden, and could, within hours, overwhelm burned-out Dresden and the lightly defended (perhaps the last) German \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfront\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which the 3 Russian armies eventually ignored in their gallop to capture their ultimate prize, Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, some time in 1945, in Estonia, Amanda was allowed to work as a nurses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 aide, feeding patients and doing cleaning up. In return, she was allowed to sleep in Tonu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room and received food. Eventually, with the help of the head doctor, she was sent to study nursing at Tartu University. She returned to the hospital as a paid nurse and in 10 years rose to the position of head nurse, with the responsibility for the inventory of all drugs in the hospital. This was an important and somewhat dangerous responsibility, because stealing of drugs, or missing drugs, was always punishable by Russian apparatchics (self-important Communists, often of peasant origin, trying to please their superiors).\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 12 President Roosevelt died suddenly and Vice-President Harry Truman assumed the Presidency in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 14 German Headquarters announced that Army Group Weichsel, under General Henrici was being heavily engaged by Russian armies at Frankfurt am der Oder. Colonel-General Gotthard Heinrici, head of the Army Group Vistula, had been allocated by Hitler only 150,000 untrained reserves. This was probably an overestimated number. According to Heinrici \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey together will be able to lengthen the time of the Third Reich by, at most, 12 days\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It turned out to be a little longer, 17 days, because the Russian armies bypassed the Dresden area and Berlin surrendered to the Russian armies first. Dresden was eventually overwhelmed by Russian armies, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccleaning up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, three days later.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 15 The 3 Russian Army Marshals attacked and the rushed to be the first to reach Berlin. Allied generals argued, without success, with Allied Commander-in-Chief Eisenhower, insisting that they could and wanted to beat the Russians to Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus and Rein passed through N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg. No personal recollections of that time. Except that Rein and Romulus agreed that they were a good team and started to call themselves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKaks Poiss Meest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Two Batchelors).  Indicating some hope for the future on Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 part. But, rumour had it that the hospital in which Amanda had given birth, had received a direct hit by a bomb. Things were not, as yet, alright, by any measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 18 U.S. troops lead by Generals George S. Patton and Omar Bradley crossed the German-Czechoslovak border, nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSporadic train travel towards the South, towards M\\xc3\\xbcnchen (Munich), along the Oder River, continued with Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wits and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d performances. The American Zone and safety were now within reach. Although, it was not clear to us, where the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican Zone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was going to be located.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 21. N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg (from which Romulus and Rein had just departed) was captured by the U.S. 7th Army. Russian forces under the command of Marshal Zhukov and Marshal Konev reached the suburbs of Berlin. Members of the Wehrmacht (German Army) were everywhere, dangerous, and anxiously surrendering to any US army member at the rate of 30,000 per day. Some 1.5 million were eventually put to work building camps to house the prisoners of war and refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg had been the most famous Nazi Party brainwashing  center, where huge rallies and propaganda speeches by Hitler, Himmler and Nazi architect Speer had been staged often. It was considered by the Nazis as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9choly place\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. All decked out by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cersatz\\xe2\\x80\\x9d columns imitating Greek and Roman architecture. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our visit in 2006, Rein and Mari viewed the remnants of the Nazi monuments which were crumbling on the edges of the large field, where hundreds of thousands of soldiers once stood at rapture, listening to Adolf Hitler and his henchmen. It was now a pasture for sheep and cows -- peacefully munching on grass. Somehow this seemed as an appropriate commentary on the terrible Nazi hoax. It felt good to stand on the podium, overlooking the large field, on the exact place where once Hitler stood, shouting empty platitudes in rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a background for Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speeches, Speer had built a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPotemkin wall\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with fancy Roman (Ionic) columns. That was, a fake wall, that was in fact, like a Hollywood movie set, with no real buildings behind it. Like the false fronts in movies where cowboy/actors faced each other in fake cap gun fights. This seemed to be appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn history, when the Russian Czar, Peter the Great, traveled from the centre of his power in Moscow to St. Petersburg, his summer residence, his vassals built fake \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPotemkin Walls\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, so that the Czar would not see the poverty of the indentured peasants, along the route. Interestingly, Peter traveled by train, along a route drawn as a straight line by him, from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Except for a slight detour (that still exists) that marked where he had had his thumb on the ruler that he had used to lay out the best straight and fastest route that suited him. Everyone was terrified to point this out to him that a by-pass that had been drawn because of his thumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeetings at N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg had all been a part of a big propaganda extravaganza. Albert Speer, Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Architect was good at creating an eerie atmosphere by locating thousands of spotlights, pointing directly into the dark sky, all around the field. Thousands of Nazi banners were displayed, proclaiming the coming of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA 1000 year Reich!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As the spotlights shot straight up into the sky, into infinity, they created an aura of mystery and seemingly an infinitely high wall, glorifying a superior Aryan race of hero/warriors on the field -- shouting on command \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in  loud choruses. Hands were held high in the Nazi salute. Rein could hear in his mind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye, such terrifying shouts, as he stood on the field, and as he had heard many times some 62 years before. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow we, thankfully, recognized that the Nazi super race had been nothing more, than sheep and fake Hollywood cowboys, who had been playing deadly games in a pasture. Hitler had seen the blond and blue-eyed Estonians as a part of his \\xe2\\x80\\x9chistoric\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, dispersed, Aryan race, to be assimilated with the German people. He himself was a short, black haired, Austrian, a born out of wedlock bastard. Such a person he would have wanted to be exterminated, to keep the German race pure under his Nazi philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Famous Nazi War Crime Trials would be held, in the future, symbolically, at N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg, a city, that, at the time, had been 91% destroyed by Allied bombing. Starting in November, 1945 the trials continued for 2 years. In the end, most Nazi criminals escaped conviction, by committing suicide or because of the incompetence of the judges and jury, that complained they had no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprescidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to follow. It was their duty to establish prescidence for future generations that may (will) face similar atrocities. Invaluable evidence was destroyed by lawyers and judges, who apparently lost interest because they were no longer the most important news on the media and they wished to get on with their money-making private careers. Only relatively insignificant Nazis were hanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 22 American troops captured Stuttgart, Baden-W\\xc3\\xbcrttenberg , which is near Geislingen (Steige) where Rein and Romulus eventually ended up in a large  Displaced Persons camp for several years. The camp was made up of some 15,000 Estonians. In 2014 it would have been the same size as the tenth largest city in Estonia, Kuresaare, the capital on the largest Estonian island of Saaremaa. The island is one of 15 counties of Estonia, called Saare County, which is also composed of some smaller islands. (Estonia is surrounded by 5,000 islands).\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 26 Last German Army detachments fled Stettin region and the city was finally captured by the Soviet 19-th, Army, overcoming the entrapped German Second Army. Thereby the Russian armies had finally captured the entire Baltic Sea coast, including that of our home-country, Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nApril 27 American and Russian forces met at Torgau, on the Elbe River near Leipzig, a place we had escaped from days earlier. Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Germany had now been cut in two. Romulus and Rein had recently passed through Leipzig, by German passenger train, which was now in the Soviet Zone, soon to become East Germany. \\r\\n\\r\\nApril 28. Partisan machine guns killed Benito Mussolini (Nazi friend of Hitler and dictator of Italy) and 12 of his former cabinet officers at Lake Como, Italy. He had been on the run since his rescue from prison in September, 1943 by Hitler. Il Duce, had been discovered hiding beneath a pile of coats in the back of a truck. He had begged for mercy. But his 61-year-old body was brutalized and hung upside down in Milan\\'s Piazza Loretto, along with that of his mistress Clara Petacci. All German armies in Italy surrendered unconditionally by the next day. This must have terrorized Hitler, who was now very worried about his own safety, and the possibility of being humiliated and brutalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 29, 1945:  Augsburg, in Southernmost Bavaria, ended up as the ultimate goal of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 escape route. Before reaching it, we were captured by a unit of the American 7-th Army in the nearby town of Weilheim.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany remaining German generals in the region had also decided to hide there to escape from running and sporadic fighting. In the little town of Weilheim there was actually a place called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe House of Generals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, where they waited for the American army to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cofficially\\xe2\\x80\\x9d capture and arrest them. They were playing cards while they waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Rein and Romulus had also accidently escaped, by the skin of their teeth, from both the German and Russian armies. They had reached the American Zone, in the far southern part of Bavaria in Germany, and at almost the end of the War.\\r\\n\\r\\nA childhood memory remains. Romulus and Rein witnessed the final military event of their flight to safety. Rein and other children were playing on the sidewalk of the main street of Weilheim. A smart looking formation of German soldiers, in striking black, all spit and polish, everyone approximately six feet tall, came marching down the street, to our surprise.They were a part of Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elite SS guard, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSwartzwaffe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (that is, dressed in black uniforms). Apparently the city was officially surrendering to the Americans without a fight. We children couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imagine how anyone could beat such an elite/mighty German formation of soldiers. Maybe the Americans were actually 8 feet tall, and black, just like father, Romulus, had imagined that American soldiers would be?\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, turning the corner at the end of the main street, the victorious Americans made an appearance. They were lead by a Jeep, driven by a somewhat disheveled looking fellow, steering the Jeep with his feet. He and his fellow soldiers were tossing chocolate and candy onto the sidewalks to the kids. On the back of the Jeep was another soldier manning a mounted machinegun. The Americans were not eight feet tall! And spit and polish was certainly not evident!! Incredible? These soldiers had actually defeated the Germans? As children we were puzzled!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn both sides of the street, came soldiers who dashed into houses, upstairs and downstairs, looking for weapons and potential combatants. Now and then they emerged from a house with an ancient hunting rifle, or the like. They would grab the barrel with both hands and bend it against the corner of the house. As the lead Jeep progressed down the street, upper bedroom windows opened and white bed sheets of surrender were hung out.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and the children hsd been taught during the war not to pick up any boxes that looked like candy. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWestern Allies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d used to drop such booby-trapped packages from their airplanes. They blew up in your face when you attempted to open them. This brilliant act was apparently a part of a campaign to demoralize German civilians, especially the dangerous children, I guess. To deal with the children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apprehensions, the American soldiers opened up the packages they had thrown and handed them to the children, demonstrating that there was no danger. Chocolate! What a treat! Even much better than potato peel soup!\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and other children watching this parade came to the conclusion that the Americans, while not actually 8 feet tall, had beaten the magnificent German soldiers because they could shoot around corners with their bent gun barrels.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Weilheim also had become the home of Admiral Horthy and his family, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cappointed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Regent of Hungary, soon after Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defeat. The American Army had released him from a German concentration camp. The Admiral spent some time thereafter in custody, where he was held as a possible witness during the Nurenberg Trials. In August, 1947 he was still under house arrest in Weilheim. We had long departed from our first safe haven, Weilheim, for Augsburg, by that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 29 turned out to be a day of infamy, a memory that has lived on in Romulus and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind. According to U.S. army dispatches, a James Dorris and his army unit were sent inadvertently to Dachau, to investigate whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome sort of a camp might be there\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Upon the troops\\' arrival, he recalled, that, \"insanity was everywhere. As I met their blank stares and saw their starved bodies...it was more than I could take. I said to myself that this is what HELL must be like.\" Unexpectedly elements of the United States Third Army had come upon the horrendous Dachau Concentration/Death \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp in Bavaria. Located in Bavaria, South-east of M\\xc3\\xbcnchen, and close to Weilheim, where the Petersons had fortunately reached the American Zone and safety. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe camp commandant, one Martin Weiss, had hurriedly left, well before the Americans arrived, with most of his staff. He had placed the camp in charge of SS-Obersturmf\\xc3\\xbchrer (lieutenant) Skodzensky, with orders to surrender as soon as the Americans arrived. Senior Nazis were concerned that prisoners, some of them common criminals and many communists, would escape and try to take revenge by terrorizing local German civilians. It was extremely unusual for such a large camp to be placed in charge of such a low ranking officer, but desperate times were at hand.Some of those that ran away probably escaped from Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Germany and their deserved punishment for murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nDachau was not set up as a death camp only, although many prisoner/slaves died there. In addition to being a prison camp, Dachau was also both a training centre for Waffen SS troops, as well as a hospital for SS troops who had been wounded on the Eastern (Russian) front. Unfortunately, for the wounded Waffen SS troops, to get into the concentration camp proper, American soldiers had to go through their designated area. Shocked and disgusted American soldiers \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberating\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the camp, subsequently did not distinguish between Waffen SS soldiers who were wounded and those SS units that were guarding the camp. They killed them all in an orgy of violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the US soldiers saw at Dachau horrified them to such a degree that they simply lost control and reportedly killed over 500 German soldiers in cold blood. This included their commanding officer, who was trying to surrender. About 40 were shot in the legs and then left to be finished off by former prisoners with shovels or clubs. Wounded SS soldiers, mostly from the Eastern front, were dragged from their hospital beds and dealt with in the same manner. The US soldiers acted like crazed animals. General Patton tried subsequently to cover up this wanton massacre. He did not want to reveal to the world the loss of discipline and humanity by US soldiers, under his command. Such an admission would have revealed the atrocities that had occurred on all sides in the War, not only by the Russian and Nazi German soldiers. \\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus and Rein had also learned, by that time, that all humans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 have only a thin civilized veneer over their persona. Underneath lurks egotism, self-preservation and psychic behaviour that we blame, somewhat unfairly, only on animals. This is why religion or \\xe2\\x80\\x9chumanizing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d philosophies, along with a civil society, with fairly enforced Laws, are crucial to taming the animal instincts that all humans possess.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had become standard procedure, by American troops, when entering each town to summon the B\\xc3\\xbcrgermeister (mayor) and have him direct all citizens to turn in their weapons and cameras for confiscation. If the unit was to remain overnight, the B\\xc3\\xbcrgermeister was forced to arrange for billets in private homes, gasthauses, chateaus or whatever was available. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy this date, German defenses had lost all coordination, but here and there were isolated fanatical Nazi SS squads who continued a stubborn defense of road blocks and strong points to make life still uncertain for the men in the U.S. cavalry detachments. Hour after hour, day after day they had to overcome a special type of personal fear \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the fear of the unknown. No soldier wanted to die, after surviving the five years of War, as a result of a meaningless ambush at the end of the War. Where, when and how, they would next be met by enemy fire\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 from machine guns behind the next knoll, hill or river line? Many atrocities were carried out by trigger happy soldiers, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmopping up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in mistaken self-defense and fear. No one felt safe, eventhough. But the war was supposedly over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work of disarming the Germans and attempting to establish Military Government in the areas just conquered had begun. As can be imagined the entire country was in complete chaos particularly in the larger towns where Allied bombing and shelling had destroyed transportation and all public utilities. Most of the Nazi officials and technicians who had governed and operated these towns had either fled or gone underground for fear of reprisals.  There were shortages of food and other necessities. Looting was rampant\\xe2\\x80\\x94not only by Germans, but by Allied troops as well. Crooks, highwaymen, and convicts from prisons without guards, and all sorts of other vermin, took advantage of the break down of order.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 30 Adolf Hitler and his wife, whom he had just married, Eva Braun, committed suicide in his Berlin bunker. Their bodies were supposedly burned by their immediate, trusted, Nazi guards. The Russian military did not allow Allied forces to corroborate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 1 Joseph Goebbels had a physician give his 5 children lethal injections, then an SS orderly shoot him and his wife, and then burned their bodies, also at Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Berlin Bunker.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 2 After a 2 week battle for Berlin, the German garrison surrendered, at the Potsdam Bridge, to the First White Russian (Belorussian) and First Ukrainian Armies at 12:50 local time.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large group of German rocket engineers and scientists from the secret war weapons research base at Warnem\\xc3\\xbcnde surrendered to American forces. They become a part of the well paid nuclear bomb and rocket missile research group at Los Alamos, New Mexico. They continued to serve destructive war programmes, but now for their new American masters (without  really skipping a beat). A similar group of Nazi scientists was captured by the Russians and ended up working on Russian missile and nuclear programmes. A new competition was on! What a wonderful world of science without ethics. Anything was game to further your own career and to save yourself from retribution! They were getting ready for the next War, I presume!?\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 4 the XX Corps of the 7-th US 7-th Army entered Berchtesgaden, in the mountains of Southern Bavaria, near the Austrian border, without resistance. It had been regarded by the Germans to be the safest place in Germany and several of the wounded German generals and other officers had been sent there to recuperate. Western Allies had convinced themselves that fanatical Nazi Germans and Hitler would eventually choose a heroic death in the Bavarian Alps, somewhat like in the fourth and last opera of the German Wagnerian Ring by Richard Wagner --- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDie G\\xc3\\xb6terd\\xc3\\xa4mmerung\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nPure fictional nonsense, as it turned out to be. So much can be said for much of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrilliant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d espionage, war plans and theories that generals, field marshals and other war strategy leaders concocted. Those of us, as refugees, caught in between, learned to take advantage of the sloppy military \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecurity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, these were definitely oxymoron terms. There was no such thing as real war intelligence.Thank God for the stupidity of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWar intelligence and its warriors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Because of them there were always ways for us to escape and survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein went to Berlin in 2013 to hear the whole WagnerianOpera Ring, over 5 days. Rein remembered that the last piece of music played by the Berlin Symphony, just before they were captured and arrested by the Russian soldiers, was Die Gooterdammerung (Wagner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conception of the end of the world). \\r\\n\\r\\nOur theatre, Unter der Linden, was close to the Symphony Centre where the brave musicians had showed their mettle.When in 2013 they again played this last piece of the Wagnerian Opera, Rein was brought to tears. It sounded like doomsday, rather than the promised end of our world by some form of Christianity. Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perceive much hope for his Wagnerian Opera future. He resigned from his membership of the Wagner Society of Toronto in 2014, where we had met, to pretend, that we were having intelligent discourses at the Arts and Letters Club. Instead it had proven to be a weird social club, where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintellectuals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tried to satisfy their overblown egos and absurd status roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBerchtesgaden was 120 kilometers from Weilheim where Romulus and Rein were finally captured by the 101-st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, commanded by a Lt. Col. Milton Kandall. By morning of 29 April, they had cleared the Weilheim area of all German soldiers, including the German soldiers who had marched down our street so arrogantly. We were shortly after that loaded on trucks and sent on our way to M\\xc3\\xbcnchen/Augsburg. All this became clearer, according to reports available to Rein after the War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War with Japan continued. A desperate Japanese Premier Kantaro Suzuki addressed the Japanese people on the state of war: \"We are fully prepared and we have in our forces... an unsurpassed strategic skill\". Actually they had already lost most of the War in the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear Hamburg, Northern Germany, the first unconditional surrender of one million troops of German land, sea, and air forces in Holland and Denmark, facing the Canadian 1st Army and British 2nd Army was arranged. German General of the Army and Commander in Chief of the Navy Admiral von Friedeberg, signed the surrender terms for Germany. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery was very proud to sign on behalf of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied Commander-in-Chief. This apparently fulfilled Montgomery\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-aggrendizing dreams, in part.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 5 The Czech resistance movement captured Prague, and made an urgent radio call for Allied aid against German counterattacks. Western allies failed to help and eventually Russians captured Czechoslovakia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 7 at 14:41 a German delegation headed by Admiral Doneitz, formally the German head of state, after Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suicide, signed another unconditional surrender documents at Rheims. The following day war in Europe was declared officially ended. German Generals actually signed many surrender documents all over Germany, all co-ordination had collapsed.The many surrender ceremonies also reflected the competition among Allied generals, who were all looking for glory, to be the one that had accepted German surrender. The German Generals, involved, were trying to escape punishment by Allied troops, by being the ones \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto surrender what remained of the Nazi state. There was little honourable bahaviour involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 7 A German submarine torpedoed a Canadian merchant ship, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvondale Park\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This was the last Allied ship lost during the war of the Northern Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 8 Dresden finally surrendered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cofficially\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on V-E Day (Victory-in-Europe Day), in one of the final military \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the war against Germany. How ignoble this must have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 9 Libau radio in Latvia courageously announced the formation of a National Latvian Government, and that the occupying German troops would continue to fight now for the Latvian Government. The Soviet Government was requested to cease hostilities, but refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 10 In waters off Nova Scotia, Canada, German submarine U-889 surrendered to Royal Canadian Navy ships.\\r\\n  \\r\\nMay 23 General George S. Patton became Military Governor of Bavaria, where we were living. Romulus and Rein had been captured by the Sixth Army under one of the most famous of American generals. This had  been Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ultimate escape strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish forces surrounded Gl\\xc3\\xbccksburg, and took Albert Speer prisoner. At Flensburg, Germany, the final Nazi government, under Admiral Karl D\\xc3\\xb6nitz was also arrested. Heinrich Himmler swallowed a cyanide capsule, during cross-examination by a British army doctor, and died.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\nJuly 10 Boundaries of American, British, French and Russian Zones were reluctantly agreed to by the Allies and Russia. Berlin was to become an isolated shared island in the middle of the Russian zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 6 and 9 Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, respectively, were bombed with 2 Atomic bombs, 100,000\\xe2\\x80\\x99s were murdered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enola Gay flying at 31,600 feet altitude dropped the first 4400 kg. uranium-based atomic bomb (Little Boy) over Hiroshima, Japan, set to detonate at 1850 feet above the city. The blast had the impact of a 500-mph wind, leveling almost everything within a two-mile radius. It destroyed 70,000 buildings, sixty percent of the city, and 70,000 victims were killed, and 80,000 wounded. The atomic bomb became one of the largest man-made explosions in history. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree days later, on\\xc2\\xa0August 9, the U.S. dropped a plutonium\\xc2\\xa0implosion-type\\xc2\\xa0bomb (Fat Man) on the city of Nagasaki. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed 90,000\\xe2\\x80\\x93146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000\\xe2\\x80\\x9380,000 in Nagasaki.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombs killed fewer people than had unreportedly perished in the Allied bombing conflaggaration in Dresden, on February 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 15, 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 15 Japan surrendered after Emperor Hirohito gave orders to the Japanese prime minister that he must end the war as soon as possible, because of the devastating destruction created by the 2 atomic bombs. Emperor Hirohito addressed the people of Japan and the Allied Forces Leaders, and announced the surrender of Japan by radio. The Japanese people were agast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWar against all of the Axis Alliance (German, Italian and Japanese troops) had come to an end, finally!\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 25 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHochfeld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d camp in Augsburg became one of the early large Estonian refugee, displaced persons (D.P.) dispersion camps. Rein and Romulus entered the camp registry, but actually ended up living in an apartment in downtown, Augsburg. They awaited transfer to another camp. Romulus searched for Amanda among the refugees in the camp and heard confirmation that the hospital in which Amanda gave birth had been bombed. He also started looking for his friend, who was supposed to help Amanda escape from Tallinn, if the Russians were about to enter the city of Tallinn. Later, eventually, he was (probably) lied to by this former friend that Amanda had refused to escape, because of the baby and because she believed Romulus would come and rescue her. His story was never  confirmed, one way or another. Amanda did not want to talk about it, after the War.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Estonian newspaper in Germany called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEesti Rada\\xe2\\x80\\x9d started publication at Hochfeld. Rein started, for the first time, to go to grade one school, in an attic, with excellent teachers, all of whom had escaped from the best schools in Estonia. It is amazing to realize that life among the refugees tried to continue as normally as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1946\\r\\nMari and Kenneth travelled with mother, by passenger ship to Accra, Gold Coast Colony (Ghana) in Western Africa and stayed at a mining camp with her father, for 10 months, before returning to London. Linda (Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sister) was born in Africa on October 15. Schooling for Mari and another girl was provided by various parents at the camp. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father taught them mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir house was built on stilts to ward off the snakes and heavy rains. The legs of the beds were put into cans of turpentine to prevent various poisonous bugs from crawling up into bed. All the closets had high wattage light bulbs to decrease the dampness and mildew. The water pipes for the houses ran along the ground and became overheated during the day and one had to wait until the evening to be able to use the water for taking a bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother and father went to the clubhouse for the whites and often played golf. Sometimes Mari and Kenneth joined them, or they were looked after by a neighbour or the houseboy. The clubhouse was the central gathering place. Mari remembered that on a Christmas party a Santa Claus came, who had coloured his nose red with lipstick. Bacause of the heat the lipstick melted into the pores of his nose, and wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wash out, and the children knew the next day who actually their Santa really was.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarfa was in charge of several servants: houseboy, cook, gardener, cleaner, and guard (when there was some dispute). The gardener killed a 20 foot Black Mumba snake in the garden and there was a celebration in the gardener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s village that night, where they ate the snake. They could hear the drums and the singing most of the night at the natives main camp. The gardener, with an unusual name \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResnifflegrissy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, also killed some smaller snakes such as vipers. The snakes were attracted to the camp by the chickens that Marfa tried to keep for fresh meat and eggs. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion someone installed the head of a huge snake on the Paulus family compound gate post. The meaning of this native signal was lost on the white population.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toys were stolen on one occasion and were later found in the chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oval hut and returned. Mari was responsible for herding her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turkeys and feeding the baby chicks. One of the turkeys wandered off on one occasion, and a worried Mari had to go up a hill to retrieve it. The turkeys were large and they had a heavy weight tied to their leg \\xe2\\x80\\x93 quite a challenge for a six year old.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarfa had built a screen around a tall tree to protect and house some wild canaries. This probably caused some comment among the natives. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father bought her an animal called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPotto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a very small bear-like creature. It slept in the wire-netting outside the window, unfortunately a gust of wind slammed the window shut and broke its arm and the Potto died.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the black children wore school uniforms, and white children were not welcome in their school. The black people went around bare footed, the white children had to wear shoes because of the pin-worms that would bore under their skin and hatch eggs. The children also had to wear pith helmets or hats while in the hot sun (usually more than 40 Celsius, except during the rainy season).\\r\\n\\r\\nMarfa made face masks for the mine workers to keep the mining dust out of their lungs. Women and girls were not allowed in the mines because it was thought to bring bad luck. Also nobody was allowed to whistle underground. To protect against explosive gas leaks, canaries were taken in cages underground to warn by their death the existence of poison in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in a train station, a black lady licked her finger and stroked over Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very blonde hair (bleached white by the sun) to see if it had been white washed. Mari also noticed big vultures flying around the station, eating carrion, and thought that they had beautiful coloured heads. Africa was a very different experience for the Paulus Family. But Alexander Paulus, the Estonian Liberation War Hero, and the Captain of the Takaradi Gold Mine, enjoyed it and earned a good lving for his family. It eventually disabled and killed him.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t        \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK THREE: TRANSITION\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIt takes strength to survive.\\r\\nIt takes courage to live on.\\r\\n\\r\\n------ Dwight D. Eisenhower\\r\\n\\r\\n1946 - 1947\\r\\nAfter the Second World War, about 42,000 Estonians lived in refugee camps in the Western Allies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 occupation zones of Germany. During the Second World War, about 80,000 people escaped to the West (Germany, Sweden and Finland) from Estonia. These refugees then were eventually settled in Canada, USA, Australia, U.K., etc. by the United Nations refugee agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 8, American Military Administration and U.N.N.R.A. (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) established a large (more than 15,000 persons) Estonian D.P. camp at Geislingen (Steige). We were located in three city neigbourhoods, Schlosshalde (where we lived), Rapenekke (with its Dutch style red roofs) and downtown Geislingen. German owners were evicted from their own houses (as War reparation) and the houses turned over to the refugees through UNRRA. Also turned over to the refugees was the High School building located downtown, as well as a large recreation centre/theatre called Jaanhalle. The latter two were located in the middle of native German people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s zones. This was not appreciated by the locals. Especially the young boys, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age or older, who made trips to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s downtown school hazardous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Estonian refugees in Germany faced the danger of being turned over to the Russians who claimed them as USSR citizens and as persons who had served in the (enemy and losing) German army and therefore were really prisoners of War. President Harry Truman (bless him) said to the Russians  that he would not \\xe2\\x80\\x9csend them back as yet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and thousands of Baltic refugees were eventually declared as being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstateless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The matter was not settled, in our favour, until three years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Estonians in the camps believed, unreasonably, that Estonia would soon to be set free again and that their stay at any camp was temporary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Geislingen camp became like a small Estonian town with all the services, including doctors, Police (Romulus served in the Camp Police), concerts, opera, song festivals and theatre. The camp store was stocked by the American government with a wider assortment of food, personal products and clothes, than the Germans in the town had access to. Rein attended the Estonian School up to grade 4 in downtown Geislingen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xc3\\x95petaja\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Reverend) Hinno in Geislingen, was an alcoholic, and shunned by many in his congregation. He had a profound impact, unknowingly at the time, on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s faith. We shared a house with his family. He worked very hard in preparing his sermons at his desk, but lapsed into heavy drinking occasionally, for reasons that Rein did not know, nor could he understand at the time. To a boy growing up, Hinno made an indelible impression of a good man fighting his inner \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdemons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, successfully, most of the time.  He said once to Rein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo as I teach, not as I do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was the first time that Rein was made aware of the weaknesses that we, as humans, are all prone to battle. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein came to believe that humans have animalistic behaviours, stimulus-response instincts that if not over-ruled by our inner will and self, can debase our very human existence. Evolution from our animistic origins is far from complete. We are still learning and evolving from our self-preservation, seek-hunt-kill instincts.We need to use our God-given free will to pursue good, to arise above our base instincts. Rein has learned to observe this dual nature in all people and to learn from the inner struggles of others and those of his own. Negative role models can have a positive impact, as in the case of Rev. Hinno.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandmother Amalie engaged in black market trading of goods available in Camp stores, versus fresh foodstuffs, etc. from local Germans/ farmers. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school bag became the mode of delivery of goods from the camp to the city and vice-versa, past American military guard posts, that were set up around the camp. Grandmother was the best entrepreneur in the Peterson family and Rein learned his first entrepreneurial lessons from her, not knowing that this would become his life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work later on. Rein learned how to endear himself to the US soldiers guarding the camp \\xe2\\x80\\x93 being cute, smiling and joking with them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a wonderful poor refugee boy in lederhosen (leather German shorts)!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein seldom carried books home to do homework. Business was business.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt became obvious that Amanda had not escaped to Germany and probably had died in the hospital bombing. Rein missed his mother and practiced singing of a song he had learned, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother dear mother, to me you are so dear, I rest in your lap, my very little head \\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein dreamed about singing this little song in Estonian to his mother, when they met again (hopefully soon) in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Romulus was doing an excellent job as mother/father, he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother. Several people have asked Rein as to how he managed to live without a mother during those times. It actually was not so bad. Many mothers of other children acted as surrogate mothers and looked after \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis poor urchin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He used to boast that he had many mothers, not just one. Rein recalls, especially, Mrs. Lainurm who lived in an adjacent apartment and regularly looked after him. She had two daughters \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMalle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUrve\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Malle became a close friend for many years. Mr. Lainurm was very clever and built a radio from tin cans and old wire that he wound tightly to create parts. We were the lucky ones who could listen to a radio all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Malle committed suicide in the early 1970s. She unexpectantly came to the Peterson house at 14 Hilldowntree Rd. Rein had not seen her for many years and it was a pleasant surprise. She was probably actually reaching out for help and very depressed. Rein did not pick up her signals and missed  a chance to be of help. Next day she took her own life. She had been unhappily married to an Estonian who worked at Ryerson. Rein knew him as not a nice fellow.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhile in Geislingen, Romulus worked at night in the camp police force. Rein sneaked out of the first floor window, almost every night, to play with his friends. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat Romulus didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt him\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his premise. Although Rein had to be careful because Romulus would stop by on his official policeman rounds, periodically, to check that Rein was alright. Exciting war games and especially pirate games (based on popular American movies of the time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a little bit like Pirates of the Caribbean in 2007) took place. In the late evenings, on top of Schlosshalde hill, among a hilltop of old fortress ruins, with other Estonian children, war games raged. To make \\r\\n\\r\\n                                          \\r\\n\\r\\n                                              \\r\\n\\r\\nrapiers (swords) from wooden sticks, the best hand guards could be fashioned from stolen tops of air-raid sirens, that were located on the roofs of many houses. It became hard to find any air raid sirens that still had a cover in Schlosshalde. The adults couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figure out where they went. We each hid our magnificent rapiers away from our homes. A version of pirates fighting pirates continued on most agreed upon nights. This was unbelievably exciting for a 10 year old to participate in!\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving lived through several years of the War, all the camp kids were adventuresome and somewhat unruly. Peace, order and regimentation, that had come after the War, in a D.P. camp, was much too tame for most of us \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpre-teenagers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We also had to catch up on being just kids, rather than refugees running for our lives. Hell-raising was the answer and we got into a lot of mischief that attracted the attention of the camp police. Fortunately Rein was never caught by constable Romulus, although he had some close escapes (e.g. by hiding fully dressed under his bedcovers).\\r\\n\\r\\nFights with German kids, on the way to school, which was located downtown, were daily events. The older German children didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appreciate Estonians living in their former homes. They called us \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdamn foreigners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cverfluchte auslanders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and derogatorily \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD.P.s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. If you were late to go to school, missing the relative safety of a group of Estonian students, you had to run the gauntlet of older German boys who seemed to be waiting behind every corner. Rein learned how to fight, run and hide. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRhein Petershon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which in German would mean \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPure son of Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In later years Rein learned to appreciate, because he could relate to, the popular country song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA boy called Sue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. A father, in the song, had named his son \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so that he would learn to fight and defend for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 20 the trial of some of the major Nazi war criminals by the International Military Tribunal began at 10 a.m. in N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg, Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Army needed an armed group to guard the German prisoners. After training, an Estonian Guard Co. number 4221, was set up from former Estonian soldiers. They were entrusted with guarding the N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg International Tribunal courthouse, exterior and perimeter. Interior guard duty was the responsibility of Americans. The Estonian Company also guarded the prison, and the various storage depots of gasoline, coal, ammunition and materiel. As well, Estonians were entrusted with guarding the YMCA, swimming polls, and in some cases the residences of senior and important American personages - officers and prosecutors. The Company operated effectively until 1949, earning several commendations from the American Army chiefs (most of whom were anxious to get back home in the United States).The Company was disbanded when large-scale emigration abroad began, primarily to Sweden, Canada, U.S., Belgium and Australia\\r\\n\\r\\nThe N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg Tribunal sentenced Rudolf Hess and Reichsbank president Walther Funk to life imprisonment (Hess ended up being the last and only inmate of Spandau Prison at his death). Hitler Youth founder Baldur von Schirach was found guilty of participating in the mass deportation of Jews and given a 20-year prison term. Gen. Erich von Manstein was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 18 years\\' imprisonment. Admiral Doenitz, the last Nazi head of State, was found guilty of crimes against peace and sentenced to only 10 years\\' imprisonment. \\r\\nOnly twelve leading Nazis, in total, were judged guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death, including Hermann Goering, who had once been Hitler\\'s designated successor. He tried to usurp Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power toward the end of the War and was dismissed. He was arrested by the Germans, but escaped and then tried to save himself by going over to the Allies and asking them to negotiate with him a cease fire. This was rejected and he was arrested. During the trial he had tried to claim himself to be innocent and spent much time grandstanding. He was a megalomaniac. Fat Goering cheated the gallows by taking poison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose hanged October 16 included former German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop; field marshal Wilhelm Keitel; former German general Alfred Jodl; Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg; anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher; and former Austrian Nazi leader Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who had served as German high commissioner of the Netherlands. To Rein all this seemed as a very incomplete list of top Nazis who \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeserved\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be found guilty and executed. Justice was not achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed as if the Court lost interest in the complex Hearings procedures, once media coverage faded.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the senior Nazis, either, went free, escaped, or committed suicide. This was not ample punishment for the murder of 60 million people, most of whom were civilians, on all sides whether Nazi or the Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer Romulus and Rein travelled to Charleroi, Belgium. (via Aachen, as a photograph of Rein and Romulus attests). This, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite picture of his father and himself by the Aachen railway tunnel, is displayed now in his bedroom and was on the table at Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\n The train that took us there was a made up wagons meant for cattle and for freight.  Romulus had decided to try to work as a coal miner and to escape living in a D.P camp. We were housed in communal barrack \\xe2\\x80\\x9cButler Huts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, corrugated metal half-circle structures, fastened crudely to concrete slabs. They were unbearably hot when the sun was out and became unbearably cold depending on the temperature and the wind. There was no privacy, as everybody in a hut lived together and slept on two level cots. Pails were used for washing yourself and Rein suffered the indignity of having to stand naked on a bench, while Romulus insisted on giving him a regular daily bath. \\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus hated and was afraid of working in the coal mines. He was afraid because he was concerned that on his death Rein would be left on his own. Romulus had never done such hard physical work in his life before \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he was, after all, an entrepreneur. But he laboured on because he hoped to earn some money to start a new life in Europe.\\r\\nThe Commandant of the camp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife served, through the back kitchen door of their house, a glass of delicious warm red wine to all the children in the workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 camp after supper time. We drank it down, in almost one swallow, and at once ran for bed, afraid that we might pass out before arriving there. By 20:00, each night, the camp was silent, as all the children had fallen to asleep. The adults enjoyed their peace and quiet after a hard day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work in the coal mines. Rein learned to love red wine in Charleroi, and has continued the practice, at a more leisurely pace. \\r\\n\\r\\nAgain unsuspectedly these were to be echoes of the future. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Rein also ended up working first for an iron ore mining company. In the beginning of the 1980s, he served as an executive vice-president of a coal mining company. Strange how history, anticipates, teaches and repeats itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had to go to School in the German language. That was the only language the teacher spoke in common with Rein. Neither spoke it very well, but this was the only alternative. The language of mathematics often bailed us out. As a result, the only subject taught for one school year was mathematics. Rein would subsequently learn and build on this solid grounding he received in Charleroi, during his high school and university career. He eventually ended up with a PhD degree, grounded in mathematics. After Charleroi, everyone thought of Rein as having a natural talent in mathematics and kept pushing him into mathematics courses. Romulus in particular wanted Rein to study mathematics, because, he, with a grade 8 education, had always enjoyed mathematics (arithmetics?).\\r\\n\\r\\nRein never, liked or hated, mathematics and he really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possess any great special talent in that area. He finally woke up in 1974, upon being promoted to Full Professor, when he abandoned mathematical research and teaching, such as, operations research, statistics and production management courses. Instead he started to pursue the topics of entrepreneurship and strategic management. What a circuitous route, once again, given that Romulus had been an entrepreneur, with proven strategic management skills. Rein should have imitated his dad in his academic pursuits, right from the beginning. But being an entrepreneur was not a guaranteed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjob\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Romulus and, then, Rein found out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe employment contract that Romulus had signed was written in Flemish, a language which no people in our Geislingen camp spoke. But it soon became obvious that the wage paid to the coal miners was inadequate to pay for our expenses in Charleroi. We were all going broke. Eventually, Romulus decided to refuse to fulfill the Employment Contract. We were put into the Charleroi City Jail. (for some 5 months).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrussels\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and Charleroi society ladies were scandalized that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca poor young boy (Rein) had been incarcerated with criminals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Actually Rein enjoyed prison, as everyone was very kind to him as, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Kid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and looked after him. They all probably had children and Rein was an expert at ingraciating himself.  He had learned throughout the War how to behave as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe poor unfortunate refugee kid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when it served the needs of Romulus and Rein. This included the prison guards, who carried machine guns and were posted, one at each end of our long hall way. We all used, a bucket, put by our door, as a toilet. We slept on triple level bunks, with about 12 persons per cell. It was crowded and hot. But as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Kid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Rein took full advantage of any laxity afforded to him by the guards. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein started to steal sugar cubes, with the help of other prisoners, from the dining room sugar bowls. He wore a beret hat at a rakish angle, and filled up the overhang, with sugar cubes, three times a day. Every night, on the third level of his bunk bed, he quietly reloaded his stash, secretly, into an empty suitcase, linining them up one cube at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, apparently the society ladies won their day and we were released after 5 months. We had no money. Romulus was able to sell Amandas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furs which accidentally had ended up in Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suitcases. ( In turn, Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suit cases had been accidentally left with Amanda, in Estonia).\\r\\nRomulus carried out the incredibly heavy suit case (filled with our sugar cubes) from the jail. At the time sugar was being rationed in Belgium. After paying some graft, Romulus was able to buy our freedom and train fare back to Geislingen. The sugar and Amanda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furs also fetched a good price on the black market. Once again we traveled by cattle train, Rein can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember why or how this came about.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus and Rein returned back \\xe2\\x80\\x9chome\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Amalie and Daniel in the Geislingen D.P. camp. Romulus decided we needed to immigrate, leave Europe, to escape the refugee camps --- anywhere would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently no country receiving immigrants had a refugee immigration category for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle man/entrepreneur, with a young dependent child\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Apparently Canadian government bureaucrats also didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t consider fatherhood, surviving the War, being an entrepreneur/retailer as impressive enough personal skills. Yet a kindly Canadian bureaucrat, unable to find a category on his immigration decision sheet for, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca single man with child\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, nor could he find anything in his instructions. He stamped, with some bravado, our application as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAPPROVED\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Such apparently small incidents do determine our path through life.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus prepared, with the help of Estonian refugees, fake documents certifying him as a Textile Machine Operator. But, unfortunately, it turned out, that the Canadian textile industry was dying. So, finally, Romulus had to agree to work 12 months as a farm labourer. As Romulus described it, it would involve \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshoveling shit in a farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s barn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Rein had to remain in the Geislingen camp until Romulus could prove that he was able to support him in Canada. This required that they live apart for 6 months, one in Canada, and the other in Germany. Romulus sailed from Bremenhaven on S.S. Marine Shark for Halifax and Orillia in May, 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 1940\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and the beginning of the 1950\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a major effort was made by UNRRA (United Nations Refugee Relief Agency) to resettle all refugees outside their D.P. camps. This was fortunate, because apparently we were able to immigrate to Canada because rules were probably bent a little. The majority of Estonian refugees left Germany. Some continued to live in Germany, because they believed that they would be able to go back home to Estonia. The countries that accepted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunlimited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d numbers of refugees were Great Britain and Belgium, but most Estonians settled in the United States, Canada and Australia. In 1951 the D.P. camps discontinued their activities and the houses that had been filled with refugees were returned to the German owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing under only the supervision of Grandmother, Amalie and Grandfather Daniel, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out too well in terms of Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plan. Rein was supposed to continue to go to school in Geislingen, but preferred to run around in the streets and get in trouble with other vagrants. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grades dropped to all \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (failures), except for religion in which he got a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c5\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (A). He lied to the teachers at the school (especially Mrs. Lannus, the class teacher) that he was about to immigrate to Canada. Therefore he would not be able to be in school to receive his final report card at the end of the term. He also didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where he would be going, so that the report card couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be sent there. All this was necessary so as to escape Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wrath. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mornings Rein dressed as if to go to school, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to school. He played with his other vagrant friends all day. Some time was spent at the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSonne\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moving picture theatre, and some time was spent harassing German kids in gangs. He always returned home at supper time, as if he had been to school. Grandmother was having trouble controlling Rein, and never caught on. Many years later, in Toronto, Rein met his classroom teacher Mrs. Lannus, on the stairs leading up from the basement of St. Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, on Mount Pleasant Rd.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou lied to me, Rein, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  She suddenly accused a surprised Rein. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes I did Mrs. Lannus, sorry!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was finally the end of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grade four vagrancy. Romulus never found out. Upon arriving in Canada and going to school in a one-room country school house, Rein once again turned on his charm and passed grade 4 with flying colours. He had never officially passed more than grade 3, haphazardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, before receiving his final report card, Rein received his papers to enter a transit camp in Ludwigshaven, so as to be processed for immigration to Canada. He thanked the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdear Lord\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for solving his school dilemma. While alone in Ludwigshaven, Rein regularly escaped from the transit camp to return to Grandmother in Geislingen. He learned to travel, alone, back and forth by train (without permission) to Geislingen from the Ludwigshaven camp. Great fear was experienced on every trip, he had to change trains in Stuttgart by going to the right train track, in a huge train station was always a challenge. Grandmother was more than happy to fund these escapades.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein escaped from the transit camp usually by climbing over a fence, avoiding the camp and other police, and making a dash for the railway station. He preferred grandmother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooking, who was always glad to see him. As a matter of fact, she claimed to be psychic about Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unexpected arrivals. Often when Rein arrived, unannounced, she had his favourite food on the table waiting for him (especially \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSnowball\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Soup for desert). An important motivation for Rein was the excitement involved in getting back and forth, by train, without being caught. Rein, as an 11 year boy, enjoyed these escapades. Train conductors, station masters and caretakers in the transit camps were all willing accomplices, without being aware of all the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually all the transit papers were processed, we were deloused of all bugs/ticks and given a medical examination. We also received some shots to protect Canadians from whatever alarmed the bureaucratic minds of immigration officials at Ludwigshaven. Rein remembers that Ludwigshaven was a beautiful city with a beautiful palace that was an imitation of the palace at Verseilles, France.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 21 Rein sailed from Bremenhaven for Halifax on board a converted mine sweeper, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS.S. Marine Jumpner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein became the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (that is, the captain was the adult responsible for his safety and conduct). He was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguarded\\xe2\\x80\\x9d unsuccessfully by a sailor assigned to guard duty by the Captain. On one occasion Rein avoided the guard and crawled to the bow of the ship -- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery exciting!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Not knowing that this was a very dangerous place to be, because every so often, on a regular cycle, the bow of the old minesweeper submerged completely under the sea. The Captain sounded the emergency horn and screamed at the guardian/sailor to get Rein the hell out of there immediately. The scared sailor climbed on his stomach to the bow, and rescued Rein just in time. He and the Captain were not amused. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein was subsequently not allowed to go on the front deck anymore. His guard also became ultra-vigilant.  Rein spent his time in the wheel house playing with the Captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old fashioned typewriters, some of which he accidentally damaged. He also practiced speaking English, out of necessity, and by the time he arrived in Halifax he was able to make himself understood. The captain was not pleased with his role of being the responsible person, of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptains\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The guardian angel/sailor, I would imagine, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait for the ship to arrive in Halifax. Neither, I imagine, could the Captain. But we all survived. Thanks be to the Lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some things that neither the Captain, nor the Guardian angel/sailor ever knew about. Rein had a bunk in a cabin which housed three other people. That meant that a family of four had been broken up and one family person had to go and sleep in another cabin. Rein agreed to sell his berth to the broken up family of four, who, were more than happy to be together in the same cabin. Instead of moving to the exchanged cabin, Rein decided to hide and sleep under the dance floor in the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lounge, not known to the Captain or Angel. After his successful berth sale, Rein also convinced his former room mates, who were often violently sea sick, that he could bring them their meals for a price. He eventually provided \\xe2\\x80\\x9croom service\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for several other sea sick passengers and brought all of them their meals, for a fee. The old minesweeper ship was not built with stabilizers and pitched and heaved quite violently in the North Atlantic, in December, 1948. But everyone survived after 10 days at sea, some richer than others.\\r\\n\\r\\n1949 \\r\\nJanuary 1the SS Marine Jumpner arrived at Pier 21 in Halifax (about 9 months after Romulus also arrived there by SS Marine Shark). Pier 21is now a famous historical site where many immigrants were processed during a time before airplanes took over the task. Rein became a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRed Cross ward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and was met by a kind nurse who offered him \\xe2\\x80\\x9call the do-nuts, ice cream and milk you can eat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at a Red Cross tent. A very memorable feast that Rein will never forget. Doughnuts and ice cream have remained a favourite treat, until forbidden by the cardiac doctors and Diabetes. Rein traveled by train to Toronto, there he met with Romulus. We travelled by bus to Orillia. \\r\\n                         \\r\\nJanuary 3, Rein arrived in Orillia and was to Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 surprise, \\xe2\\x80\\x9crich\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with approximately $60.00 in his pocket (each refugee person was given $20 pochet money at start of trip). Rein had earned $40 on the ship. Romulus worked as a farm labourer for food and board and received a $45 a month salary. So $60 was a lot of money for us. Romulus had expected that Rein would have spent all of his allowance money. Not so, Rein was an expert mooch on aboard the ship. Rein bought a pair of cross country skis, with part of the money, and gave the rest to his dad.\\r\\nBOOK FIVE: TRANSFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nI am beginning to believe there is a man inside of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the Walter Johnson dairy farm, on R.R. 4 Orillia. There were some 40 cows and all the feed was grown on the farm. Rein became a good friend with\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSport\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the resident collie farm dog. It was Sport\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job to fetch the cows from the pasture twice a day for milking and he taught Rein the tricks of the trade. Rein and Sport also hunted for groundhogs, with Rein going to big groundhog holes and making a lot of noise, Sport, in turn, barked and ran from the remaining hole to hole. Eventually the confused groundhog would make a run for it and get caught by Sport. Sport preferred his groundhog meat well cured and would leave the corpse in the sunshine for several days, until it started to smell. Aside from providing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfresh\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meat for Sport, groundhog hunting was necessary for the safety of the horses that worked the land and for other farm animals that could break a leg by stepping into a groundhog hole. This was probably the end of an age when farmers worked the land by horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein went to a one-room country school, at S.S. Carolyn School No. 13. All of the children were farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 children. Rein spoke very little English for his grade level. The one-room school house had eight rows of desks, each row was designated to be used by a different grade. Miss. Reichold was the only teacher. Rein will always remember the embarrassment, when he was asked suddenly to show where, in a Canadian Atlas, he was currently located. Also, to make things worse, he was asked to trace out the route he had taken to reach Canada. He had no clue and the map in front of him was totally unfamiliar to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had traveled half way around the world and had no idea where he was on the globe. This was probably due to the way we had lived. Our travelling goals had been incremental, and short-term in nature. Daily survival and the next safe destination was all that had mattered. By being asked to familiarize himself with world geography, he was faced for the first time, with where he had been, where he was and implicitly where he was going to go in the future. Quite a shock! It was only by 2007 that Rein really got around to retracing the escape route from Markhanse Farm in Estonia to Geislingen (Steige) to Pier 21 to Johston Farm/SS 13 Carolyn School (now a private residence). This was one of the reasons for writing this book.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone day at a time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d philosophy gained a longer term time horizon in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind as he matured. He has always found no shortage of opportunities to explore. And explore most of them he did. His personal philosophy had always included the notion that one has to find out what is over the next mountain. By age 70, Rein still had a long list of places and things he wished to explore. This also had involved continued relocation of residence. He himself had owned a total of 7 homes. During his life he  ended up also retreating from a few job opportunities, that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t match his skills and personality. He was always clear about what he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do. There were no regrets about pursuing inappropriate opportunities, but, then, Rein was lucky to have always the full support of Mari. She undoubtedly suffered from preparing and uprooting too many homes, and worrying about being the primary person responsible for looking after Rein, the children, and eventually two of our elderly parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom and Independence! What do these terms really mean? Rein always taught his students that, if one has the ability to choose one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependencies, and to never be forced to do something one doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do, for a protracted length of time, one is truly free. Rein has been lucky, since arriving in Canada, to be able to follow a life and careers that has allowed for such independence. In such a state of mind, periodic setbacks really do not matter.   What mattered most was the next opportunity. This attitude Rein owed to the War year experiences and to his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 influence. He had been an excellent, entrepreneurial role model and Hero for Rein. He was someone who had gone to formal school only up to grade 8, but had the wisdom and experience of a life time of challenging events. Without his guidance Rein would not be alive today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\t--- Oliver Wendell Holmes\\r\\n\\r\\nThe teacher, Miss Reischold at S.S. Carolyne No. 13, took a liking to Rein. She turned out to be a kind and dedicated teacher who worked hard at teaching Rein English after school. She told Rein \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou Rein have a great future ahead of you in higher education\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, unlike the other farm children that she taught. Rein loved becoming the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pet and scored high grades by the end of the school year (unlike in Germany).\\r\\n\\r\\nEach day after class they would walk around the one room class room, and she would ask Rein to learn to label all the items visible. Then she proceeded doing the same outside the classroom. That is how the English language was learned and a lifelong interest in the origin of words and concepts was ingrained. (A future mentor, Professor Albert Wood at Western Business School was also to be a major influence.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom here on in, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grades improved every year. When Rein entered Engineering school he returned to Carolyne No. 13 to look for Miss Reichold, to thank her, but she was nowhere to be found. Apparently she had had a very difficult time in her marriage and had moved away. She was a wonderful mentor and the first to predict correctly Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eventual profession, Rein, himself, had no clue at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat summer at the farm, Rein, worked for pay, by acting as the driver for one of the hay wagons on the Johnson Farm during harvest time. A beautiful wise steady old white horse, and a frisky auburn brown stallion, tended to pull the heavy hay wagon unevenly, and required some careful handling.  Many close calls were burned into Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memory, as we tried to mount the steep ramp up to the second floor of the hay barn. One old steady horse, one frisky out of control young horse, and a 12 year old ex-refugee city boy not too sure of what he was doing, holding the reins. Rein sure was and is still thankful for the knowledge and steering skills of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Whitey\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, who was really in charge. She had pulled that hay load up the ramp so many times that she needed no help from a city-slicker kid from Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the mounds of drying hay were lifted, little by little, onto the wagon, one kept one eye open, for very long grass snakes that inhabited under the hay bales. The barn was a great place to play with neighbourhood farm kids. We would climb to the highest beams and dare each other to jump into the hay below. Rein has loved old barns ever since. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 25th, 1949, the second mass deportations from the Baltic States were carried out by the Soviets. Many persons from Estonia were deported to Siberia (Shakalin Island). Most of them were women and children, and grandparents of farmers who had already been repressed. One of the main objects was to force farmers to join collective farms. In April, 1945, all Estonian farms were incorporated into collective farms. In total, the March deportation victims numbered 32,536. Of those, 2,896 died in Siberian exile. In the safety of the Johnson farm, in Canada, Romulus only found out about this many years later, but he of course knew that this had been our possibility, given his experience in the first Russian invasion of 1940. Rein was totally na\\xc3\\xafve about such things and more intent on enjoying the new situation in Canada, on the farm, and at the school. Everything new was a great adventure for him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action plan of the 8th Communist Party Plenary Session of March 1950 destroyed the Estonian intelligentsia. It was reported in newspapers that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost of the educated Estonians of the older generation were declared to be bourgeois nationalist; they were dismissed from work en masse and arrested. Prisons and convict camps were filled with doctors, writers, teachers, university professors, pastors, engineers, etc. Their crime was that they did not conform to the alien ideology.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Romulus was sure that he would have also been deported because he would have been declared a capitalist \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpetite bourgeois\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We were both very thankful to have been able to escape to Canada and to start a new life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 25 Milvi Peterson (wife of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother T\\xc3\\xb5nu) was deported along with her mother and siblings to Novosibirsk, Siberia from Tartu. \\xc2\\xa0Entire families, including children and the elderly, were deported without trial or prior announcement. There was no warning, just a loud KNOCK on the door of their home. Milvi was 9 years old.\\r\\nNearly 3% of the Estonian population were seized in a few days and dispatched to remote areas of Siberia in cattle train wagons. Milvi and her mother ended up in Vengrosti Rajoon, near Novosibirsk, at the Pokroskina Collective farm. \\xc2\\xa0The deportation was demanded by the Communist Party in order to complete \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccollectivization of farms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9celiminate the kulaks as a class\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In the words of the Estonian Communist Party Secretary, Nikolai Karotamm, families were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrabbed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in order to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfill a quota\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. These deportations were declared to constitute a\\xc2\\xa0crime against humanity\\xc2\\xa0by the Soviet Parliament of Estonia in 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the summer and the haying season, in September, Romulus and \\r\\n\\r\\nRein left the Johnson farm (having completed Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 labour contract) and \\r\\n\\r\\ntravelled to Toronto. Romulus was offered a job in Toronto by an acquaintance from the Geislingen camp, Villem Lohuaru, owner of Esto Construction Company. Romulus asked Rein whether they should stay in Toronto or take the Greyhound bus (across from the old Ford Hotel, where we stayed on Bay Street) and go to Montreal. Having tasted excitement and travel in Germany, adventuresome Rein chose going to Montreal, and Romulus agreed. Upon returning to Toronto, many years later, Lohuaru became Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy very last friend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at his old folks home.\\r\\n\\r\\n1950\\r\\nSenator Joseph McCarthy Begins Communist Witch Hunt. \\r\\nKorean War Begins. \\r\\nU.S. President Truman Orders Construction of Hydrogen Bomb .\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember in Montreal, Quebec, Romulus got a job at Steinberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s food supermarket as cleaner/janitor, working the night shift. Romulus was ashamed of his level of English and therefore preferred the night shift.\\r\\nRein went to grade 6 at Iona School in Snowdon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus and Rein lived in a 3 bedroom apartment with 3 other Estonian families, at 4585 Dupuis Avenue. We lived in what was supposed to be the living room. We shared a common kitchen. The other 3 families subdivided their single bedrooms into smaller sub-rooms by hanging blankets on ropes that were strung from wall to wall. In this way they created some privacy and a feeling of having several rooms. We were still in a refugee mentality and used to living crowded, in camp-style. No one was sure about having a secure job, they all were paid minimum wage and unsure about being able to earn an income that would pay their expenses. No one knew how much it really would cost to live in Montreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second floor (below us) lived the Lattiks, a well known Estonian family, Jaan Lattik had been a famous intellectual in Estonia, his son Aldo had apparently immigrated earlier than us to Montreal. It was while here that Rein discovered an interest in girls. Rein and the son of the Lattiks climbed up to the second floor balcony and hid under a bed, to spy on the 2 girls in their bedroom. Unfortunately the plan was incomplete, we hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t planned for an escape route, and we got caught under the bed. All hell broke out when the parents discovered us. The girls thought it was all very silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein started to deliver newspapers to make some pocket money and to buy a sleigh with metal runners. The sleigh was similar to one used in the skeleton competitions of the Olympics. It was very fast and very dangerous. Dupuis Avenue was on a hill and the street regularly iced up. Rein would steer the sleigh down the hill at breakneck speed, lying on his stomach and steering with his feet, hanging over the back of the sleigh. The challenge was at Lavoie Avenue, a cross-street at of the bottom of the hill, which, more often than not, had traffic that crossed Dupuis. On one memorable occasion Rein, with his eyes closed, in fear, luckily passed, on his sleigh, under the empty trailer of a truck, that was crossing Dupuis. A charmed life obviously, the Lord looks after those who cannot look after themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n1951\\r\\n Truman Signs Peace Treaty with Japan, Officially Ending WWII. \\r\\nWinston Churchill Again Elected Prime Minister of Great Britain. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein went to grade 7 at Van Horne School. Mr. Cochrane was a tough task master and had high expectations for his students. This was a new school and a lot of construction was still going on in the area. Rein was bullied by older students and his father had to come and intercede on his behalf, several times. Rein probably looked like a refugee kid and spoke with an accent. On one occasion, he was chased by a bunch of older boys and escaped by leaping across a construction ditch to escape his pursuers. While in the air he noticed that, sticking out from the other bank, was a metal reinforcing rod. If Rein hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t twisted his body away from it, he would have been speared through his chest. The reinforcing rod scraped a big gash into the left side of his chest, a scar that is still visible there. But he was not seriously injured. This was probably the first taste of being mortal in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life, despite all the adventures during the War (when Romulus was in charge).\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus decided that Amanda had been killed in the bombing of the Tallinn hospital and remarried Alma Kiis. Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reasoning was that Rein needed a mother/female touch to look after him. Rein gained a step-brother, Jaan. We moved one block to the adjacent street at 4575 Ridgevale Avenue, into a two bedroom apartment. Rein had to sleep on the couch in the living room. This was the beginning of a rift that developed between Rein and Romulus. Rein became the odd man out, and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstep-son\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckaks poissmeest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (two young bachelors) relationship with Romulus was dead. Stepmother, as time went on, clearly favoured her own son and Romulus was caught in between. Rein became somewhat of a loner.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to deliver newspapers everyday, in the morning at 0500, The Montreal Gazette, and at 1600 after school, The Montreal Star, to earn spending money and to buy things Romulus could not afford to give him. There was considerable cash to handle, to collect and to transmit to the paper companies. A bank account was set up. On one occasion, when in need, Romulus claimed that the money Rein earned was also his and without asking him, he spent some. His name appeared on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s joint bank account (Rein was a minor and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a bank account alone). This resulted in a major row. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position was that Romulus had no right to take any of the money without consulting him. He never did that again, although Rein loaned him money several times in the future. From this time on, Rein always seemed to have more money than Romulus, in part because Rein received free room and board.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein, of course, befriended a neighbourhood dog that accompanied him on the newspaper delivery routes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpider\\xe2\\x80\\x9d became a very good friend and the second dog (after Sport) in his life. Rein never met Spider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actual owner. Spider would meet him at a street corner and the two of them would fool around while delivering newspapers --- a rather boring activity. At the end of the delivery route Spider would go home, on his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer time, at age 14, Rein got a job at a soda fountain counter in a local drug store, in Snowdon, as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoda jerk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He lied about his age. He was paid 25 cents an hour, plus tips. He prepared and sold sodas, toasted sandwiches, prepared ice cream concoctions and milk shakes. One traumatic memory from that early job was, that, while reaching for a milk shake class, the 4 level glass shelves collapsed and fell over Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm. He was lucky not to get serious wounds from the accident. This was another warning about becoming more responsible for himself?\\r\\n\\r\\n1952\\r\\nJacques Cousteau Makes Discoveries.\\r\\nPolio Vaccine Created .\\r\\nPrincess Elizabeth Becomes Queen at Age 25. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein entered grade 8 in Mr. Boyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbobo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d class (for those children who were academically or behaviourally challenged) at Herbert Symonds School. It was apparently the only school spot available in the West end of Montreal, of the Protestant School Board. Apparently we had registered too late, after the school year had already started. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaster Seargent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Boyd marched around the class with a rubber strap (probably standard School Board issue) and whacked anyone across the knuckles if they were not behaving. During each week several of the boys received a strapping on the palms of their hands (including Rein). By Christmas Rein had earned very high grades (in the 90% plus range) and was put into a Latin Class. In Latin, which Rein had never heard of, other students had learned it for 1.5 years.  Rein earned by the end of the school year only 59.5% (60% was pass). A rather condescending teacher told Rein that she would do him a favour and give him a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c60% Pass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. That was the end of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career as a Latin scholar. He did very well on all other grades, especially mathematics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Montreal Protestant School Board decided to run an experiment to see whether it was necessary for students to go to school for 12 grades or whether the high school curriculum could be reduced to 11 grades. They picked 2 of the best students from each public school in Montreal to be put in a special class for grade 9. Rein was picked as one of two top students from Herbert Symonds to attend the special experimental class. They were to be taught an accelerated, advanced curriculum, including 4 mathematics courses and advanced French, at West Hill High School. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mathematics learning in Belgium was becoming a blessing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from school Rein attended the St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Evangelical Estonian Lutheran Church and joined the boy scouts. Because he was one of the tallest boys in the school he was asked to play basketball as the centre. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very good, having no experience in the sport. After grade 8 he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow another millimeter and was still the same height \\xe2\\x80\\x93 never reaching 6 feet, which was his dream. Many years later, Dr. William A. Dymon, in Toronto, measured Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s height (perhaps for the first time), and declared that he was only 5 feet 10.5 inches tall. To which Rein responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not care, I will always believe that I am 6 feet tall!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Dymon anwered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou go ahead, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a psychiatrist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n1953\\r\\nHillary and Norgay Climb Mt.

First Estonian Government-in-Exile is established in Oslo by former Estonian government cabinet member August Rei.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn grade 9 our classroom teacher was Mr. Christmas, he was also the supervisor of French teaching for the Protestant School Board. An excellent teacher of French and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in French was sparked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut pranksterism continued to be an attraction. Rein was challenged by his classmates to find out whether Mr. Christmas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first name was actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. That would make her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerry Christmas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein called the Christmas home telephone number and asked for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. She answered, saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeaking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Rein, scared, hung up. Next day before Mr. Christmas arrived, we wrote in big letters on the board --- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerry Christmas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He was not pleased, but did not pursue the prank any further. This was the start of many pranks that members of the class and Rein got involved in the next 3 years. Rein became one of the ringleaders of carrying out such pranks. This was partly due to fact that every boy in the class was a top student (90 % or more), and a bit full of himself. Such a class was not easy to control by the teachers. We all had a lot of unspent energy and testosterone. It was a way to become a Hero for a day among one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s classmate/peers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to deliver newspapers, before school, The Montreal Gazette at 0500 in the morning, and The Montreal Star at 1600 after school (with dog\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpider\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer, Rein also got a job as bus boy and glass washer at the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Snowdon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d restaurant. He also worked there, part time, during the school year. His boss was Mr. Roth a wonderful human being. Rein was a good friend of his daughter. One day, in October, an inspector turned up at the restaurant and discovered that Rein was younger than 16, the minimum age at which one can work in Quebec. Mr. Roth pretended that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, and fired Rein, on the spot. After the inspector left, Mr. Roth told Rein to come back on October 23, 1953, his 16-th birthday, which was some 2 weeks away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the help of Jaan Kiis, his step-son, Romulus got a better paying job at Steinberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, where he became \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca packer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He loaded groceries onto the store shelves, once he had put a price on all items. His working hours were from 2000 to 0600 the next morning. He never saw day time, during the week, for some 25 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peterson family moved into a rented duplex at 4947 Earnscliffe Avenue. Rein got his own room that measured 8 feet by 7 feet. There was room for a bed and a desk for studying. Everything else was stored in a small corner closet, at the foot of the bed. This was comparative luxury and most importantly, privacy, and his first own room by age 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spent many hours listening to classical music on a small portable, old fashioned record player. He also started regularly attending the Estonian church, to overcome his feeling of extreme \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloneliness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe attended scout summer camps at L\\xc3\\xa4ttem\\xc3\\xa4e in Brownsburg and joined the school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s junior soccer team as outside right forward (because was one of the fastest runners at the school). Lunch hours and immediately after school were spent playing table tennis (ping-pong) at the school. This became a major addiction for the remaining 3 years at West Hill. Rein made very good friends and became a good player.\\r\\nMarch 5 Stalin died in Russia. Because of his brutality a total of 2,369,220 had been sent to Siberian slave camps, 765,180 had escaped into exile and 624,980 had been executed, under his brutal dictatorship. The first transition phase from Communism was starting slowly in Russia. But most of the refugees in the West had given up any hope of returning to Estonia soon. Some Estonians detainees were able to return to Estonia from Siberia, from as far away as Kemchatka, on the far Eastern coast of USSR (9,000 kilometers away).\\r\\n\\r\\n1954\\r\\nFirst Atomic Submarine Launched.\\r\\nReport Says Cigarettes Cause Cancer. \\r\\nRoger Bannister Breaks the Four-Minute Mile. \\r\\nSegregation Ruled Illegal in U.S. \\r\\nSputnik is launched by the USSR.\\r\\nIn Grade 10 at West Hill High School, Mr. King was our classroom teacher and taught the mathematics classes. Because the Russians had launched the first Sputnik satellite, that circled the earth with a dog in it, most Western nations, including Canada, paniced and wanted to quickly teach every child in North America a lot of mathematics and science. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got to keep up with the Russians or we will lose the Cold War!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As the experimental mathematics class, in Montreal, this had a major impact on us. The tempo and difficulty of the courses increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. King was reputed to have a glass eye. The question was which eye was it? Rein was selected by his classmates to determine this. Because of his reputation as a troublemaker, Mr. King had located Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk at the very front, immediately abutting the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office desk. After studying the situation carefully, Rein decided that it was the right eye. Mr. King, always faced the board sideways, Rein decided that his good eye would be facing, closer to the board, so he could see what he wrote. Rein stood bolt up straight, and threw a crumpled up wad of paper with all his might into to waste basket next to the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk. Mr. King didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a move. But the class clapped and gave Rein an ovation, which confused a startled Mr. King.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite topic, but Mr. Doyle, our teacher, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t consider Rein his favourite history student. Rein was caught several times doing pranks with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNips\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nemeroff, who sat near him, and was a bit out of control, most of the time. His favourite occupation was to get Rein into trouble. As a result, Rein spent considerable time on detention, kicked out of class and standing outside beside the History class door. By grade 10 Doyle obviously had decided that he could not put up with any more nonsense and Rein was kicked out of class for the whole year, sometime in the first term. Mr. Doyle accused Rein of some prank, Rein denied it, but, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help smiling when stared at by a livid Mr. Doyle, who had lost it. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s punishment was to stand by the door, supposedly listening to Mr. Doyle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lectures, that he could hear through the partly open door.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Doyle was a consummate pompous English gentleman, with an accent to match. We only learned English history, because apparently, according to him, nothing of any importance had ever happened in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history room was across the hall from the library and Rein decided, after a while, to sit in the library instead and read books related to the course. He memorized all the dates in English history from the Battle of Hastings (1066), through Magna Carta (1215) to Elizabeth II (1953). At the end of the year, in the final examination, Rein scored 98%, the highest grade in history at the school. On the examination he wowed Doyle with dates attached to events which he was able to inter-relate.  Mr. Doyle was pleased/upset, and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make up his mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a smart boy Rein, why are you such a bastard!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked Rein privately. Upon graduation, next year, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was posted on the wall of honour, as a top student in history in the Provincial Examinations. \\r\\n\\r\\nA poor Mr. O. E. Lewis was assigned to our class to teach us Physics and Chemistry. He actually did not have much experience in teaching these subjects, so he followed the text book very closely, keeping it furtively, partially hidden under his desk. This was considered by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe boys\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be inappropriate and he became the butt of many pranks. Rein, again, was assigned by his classmates the job of finding out what his first names were. He always signed himself as O.E. Lewis. It was clear that he did not fancy telling anyone whatever the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stood for, when someone asked him. We thought that perhaps it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOscar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which we thought would be funny. So Rein had to resort to covert methods. As luck would have it, Mr. Lewis left his wallet on the table while he was out of the class, and there on his driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license was clearly written Orlo Edward Lewis. Next morning Rein came in early and printed on the board his complete name, emphasizing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrlo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Everyone, except Mr. Lewis thought this was very funny. And \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrlo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it was after that.\\r\\nThe Chemistry laboratory had a classroom attached to it. The classroom was multilevel with seats on steps so that everyone could see the experiments conducted by the teacher. Orlo would often get frazzled when doing demonstration experiments. Once he had set up a series of beakers filled with water, and other types of liquid that could or would not conduct electricity. Each beaker had a label on the table in front of it. We reshuffled the labels. Orlo had an apparatus in his hand which consisted of a light bulb, attached to an electrical chord, and the light bulb would only light up if the two prongs on the bottom were inserted into a liquid that conducted electricity. Reading from the book (covertly) he stuck the prongs into the first beaker saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnote that this liquid conducts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Nothing happened. He tried the next beaker and declared that this should not conduct electricity. But it did, and so forth. He lost his cool to the great merriment of the class.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen teaching molecular structure on the board, with his back to us, he would discuss such things as alpha and beta particles bombarding some nucleus. The class provided the sound effects by throwing marbles into the waste basket in the corner of the room. He would say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNote that as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98beta\\xe2\\x80\\x99 particle, tut-tut-tut \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 bombards the nucleus \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this was always followed by a ker-plunck as a marble struck the wastepaper basket, at the precise moment when Beta met the nucleus. He lost his cool again and asked us to stand-up and give him the marbles, which no one did. So he decided to search us. He found nothing. Those of us who had marbles, had them in our mouth. Rein managed, to his great concern, to swallow one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of previous misdemeanors, our class was not allowed to enter the chemistry laboratory, but had to line up outside. After setting off a fire in a waste basket, that produced hydrogen sulphide (a very thick malodurous smoke), we all stood in front of the lab door with our backs to the door, seemingly not seeing the smoke (nor the smell of rotten eggs that it produced) seeping under the door. As Orlo approached the lab, he shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anyone panic. I was on fire patrol in the navy and I know how to handle this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Several times he rushed into the smoke filled room, eventually on his knees to keep low, and returned coughing, shouting encouragement to us to not to panic (like he was himself). I guess he was trying to win our respect by showing his bravery. The entire school had to be evacuated that day and sent home. Orlo was crushed by this prank. The principal became involved and we all received all kinds of punishments that are now long forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmart high school boys can be very cruel. And we certainly were! It would have crushed me too, as a teacher. I guess it was a consequence of selecting a very bright class of boys from across Montreal. We were known at the high school as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Snobs of West Hill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (a title given to us by Mr. Unsworth, the principal, at a public school assembly, and it stuck.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was invited to join the school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior soccer team and became the goalie because of his willingness to throw his body in front of shots without fear. We had a good team except for the 2 full backs (on defense). Our worst loss was 7-4 to Baron Byng High School (all Jewish students). In that game two goals were scored by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defensemen, who would panic and shoot the ball back to the goalie, unexpectedly, and too hard. Fifty years later the goalie for Baron Byng turned out to be Melvin Zwaig, a successful forensic accountant, and well known businessman who became a friend. \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo times as goalie Rein was knocked-out cold. Once a penalty shot that went through his two outstretched palms and the soggy ball hit him square in the face. Rein dropped like a sack of potatoes and passed out for a few minutes, but most importantly the ball did not go into the net. Rein can still remember the taunts of fellow players yelling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cway to use your head Sunshine !!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nick-name was \\xe2\\x80\\x9csunshine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein at first assumed it was a reflection of his sunny personality \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Oh well! On another occasion Rein lunged for the ball and each of his two arms went on the opposite side of the goal post, and his head hits the goal post. Bam! Out went the lights, again. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein was now working after school at Steinberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, responsible for stocking the frozen goods counter for about 2 hours each day. Romulus at Jaan Kiis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 intervention had been promoted to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckey man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (or night manager). He had all the building keys and was responsible for security of the store. He also was responsible for ordering the goods, receiving the merchandise that was delivered by truck and supervising some 6 packers who priced and loaded the goods on the shelves. In his mind he was back to running a retail store, just like back in Estonia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he was very pleased with his new job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing ping-pong after school, Rein would run the 3 to 4 miles at a  fast pace to be on time at work, which was OK as long as the frozen foods counter didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run out of stock. This meant that he was in fairly good physical shape. After school one day, he discovered that there was a track meet going on in the school backyard. His buddies gave him a hard time, egging him on, wanting him to participate in the one mile race. He was given someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s track shoes and sent to the start line. When he came around the circumference of the field, the first time, he asked his friends \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow far is a mile?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour times around\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the answer. Because Rein was late for work, he started to run a little faster and almost lapped the field , won the race, then took off the borrowed track shoes and ran to work \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he was late for work! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho was that guy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the coach and Rein was invited to become a member of the school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior track team as a middle distance runner.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the season, the coach recommended Rein for a tryout with the Montreal Track Club. A tryout consisted of running \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour\\xe2\\x80\\x9d distance at a time that was above the standard that had been set by the Club. Rein chose to run 880 yards. (i.e. twice around the track in the Molson Stadium). It turned out that Rein was the only one that day trying out at this distance and age class. He started to run, not knowing the pace he was supposed run at. An older club member, who was sitting in the stands, Ronnie Holtzman, noticed that Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pace was too slow. He jumped down a 6 foot wall, onto the track, and in his stocking feet, while running on the grass beside Rein, he shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go faster, I will pace you in!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After finishing the trial Ronnie went back into the stands and continued to do whatever. Rein had beaten the qualification standard and was now a member of the Montreal Track Club. Rein went to Ronnie and shouted his thank yous to Ronnie. He subsequently turned out to be also an 880 yard runner in an older age group (with a beautiful natural gait, almost as good as Roger Bannister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, the fastest mile runner in the world, at the time).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two regular practices a week lead by a coach who was a former Canadian Olympic runner, Howie Ryan. Most runners also practiced one more time, usually during the weekend. Rein learned about pace and running strategy, and of course, improving his cardio-vascular ability to run. Practice, practice, practice (including weekends) followed. He was asked, during practice, to run against the women 100 yards dash runners, to improve his own ability to accelerate his finishing speed. For endurance, he trained with the marathon and long distance runners who circled around the track effortlessly for hours \\xe2\\x80\\x93 wearing Rein out long before that. Rein learned about the technique of starts and eventually was asked to participate in club meets. Most of the 880 runners were older and more experienced, and Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do so well against them, but, apparently showed promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first track meet that Rein competed in his own class and age group was The Montreal Police Olympics. He won the 880 yards race and placed third in the 440 yard run, to his surprise. He also won in a 440 yard relay race, running third a distance of 110 yards. We set some sort of a record running a time of around 47 seconds. The Police handed out prizes to the winners and Rein received a Montreal Track Club track suit and a pair of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clatest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d running shoes (which continue to hang on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wall in his bedroom). What he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand at the time was that this made him, strictly speaking, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofessional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, because the Police paid us in hard cash, with a promise from us to take the money to buy equipment. Rein bought his equipment at Barry Richman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sport Shop on St.Catherine Street (near Bleury). This was the best and most expensive sports store in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile in school, we, as a class, with very good teachers, had managed to meet the challenge set for us and completed the concocted grade 11 curriculum material by the end of grade 10. Grade 12 was the equivalent of first year university. Typical of bureaucrats, they had developed no plan as to what to do with us in grade 11 if we were successful. Mr. Batt was assigned as our classroom and mathematics teacher. He/we decided to spend most of grade 11 reviewing all the material so as to get higher scores in Provincial Examinations for entering the University the next year in September, 1955.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a good humoured chap who really knew how to deal with a class of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSnobs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He could hit anyone with a piece of chalk when they were not behaving. He would sometimes lose his temper and shout, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou guys drive me \\xe2\\x80\\x98Batty\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with your nonesense!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This of course would be a cause for much more laughter in the class, which he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really appreciate, but never said anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein at the age of 17/18 was becoming interested in girls. He was very shy and retarded in such relationships. He joined the dancing class run for the Estonian youth by a Mr. Romberg at the International YMCA. We were taught Fox-Trot, Tango, English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rhumba \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Romberg had a small portable record player (no attached speakers) and vinyl records. The second floor hall was quite large and accommodated the 40 participants well. Romberg would announce the name of a dance, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclap, clap, clap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his hands \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we were supposed to cross across the dance floor, bow to a girl and ask her to dance. The boys and girls were always thus separated. Being very shy, Rein found this transaction difficult and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a partner for the first few dances. Romberg would put the needle on the vinyl record and the couples would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather ungracefully (especially the boys). Eventually Urve Mundi (who was a little older than Rein) walked over to the boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 side and took Rein by the hand to the dance floor. This was the start of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career as a ladies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 man. Rein dated Urve for some 12 months, going to Estonian dances and parties usually held at somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house. But Urve grew and grew and grew taller. Eventually our relationship broke up because of height. Urve subsequently married a six foot four man; she was about six foot two. They were both gorgeous Amazons when I last saw them at their wedding at our church.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to run at the Montreal Track Club, eventually he was ranked as one of the five best High School 880 yard runners in Canada.We were invited to a track meet in Ogdensberg, New York and in return they were invited to a return competition in Valleyfield, Quebec. Paul Conrad was our best 440 yard runner. The coach asked Rein to run \\xe2\\x80\\x9crabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for Conrad in a semi-final qualifying race. A rabbit was a person who ran very fast, faster than his own and the normal pace of a race. A \\xe2\\x80\\x9crabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d did not intend to finish the race, but would step aside when he became winded. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the starting gun went off, Rein took off at his top speed. Paul Conrad was supposed to pass him before the finish line. As we came down the final stretch, Rein was still running well and turned around yelling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on Paul, come on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Paul never did and Rein to his surprise won the race. Thereafter a big thunderstorm resulted in a cancellation of the 440 yard final and Rein won the event because his semi-final time was better than the winner of the other semi-final. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a Canadian track and field scout in the stands and he approached Rein and asked some questions, his name and address. Rein did not win his specialty, the 880 yard race. In Valleyfield the coach asked Rein if he wanted to represent the Club in the high jump, apparently our competitor was injured. Rein agreed having only jumped competitively very few times (and not well). In the 1950s the high jumping technique was very basic. We jumped by doing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe scissors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. On the first jump Rein cleared the height, but landed with his sharp nailed running shoe embedded in the opposite thigh, just above the knee. Rein had to withdraw from the rest of the competition because of the injury. This ended Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s short competitive career as a high jumper and as a 440 yd. dash runner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the club meets Rein continued to do well against older 880 competitors finishing towards the bottom of the top six. Rein learned how to run \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpsychologically\\xe2\\x80\\x9d against his guardian angel Ronnie Holtzman. He would run, in the early part of the race at Ron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right shoulder, breathing heavily, but would not pass him. Ron was by far a faster runner than Rein, but he unfortunately did not have the heart of a competitor. He would shout during the race, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgo ahead and pass me, damn you \\xe2\\x80\\xa6!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and if you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, he would fake an injury and fall into infield, out of the race. Another competitor in the senior class was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cButch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Theodore, who had the bad habit of running with his head held back and his eyes pointed straight up towards the sky. He and Rein were evenly matched. To beat him you had to sneak up on him, late in the race, and storm by while he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstaring at the sky\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was invited to attend the 1956 Olympics tryouts in Saskatoon. He was told that this experience would be good for him and it was not expected that he would be ready before the 1960 Olympics. Rein agonized over the decision of going to the tryouts. Eventually he decided not to go. Next year he was committed to going to McGill University for engineering studies. He had to work to earn money to pay the bills. Also, while he enjoyed running for the Montreal Track Club, the practicing was getting very demanding time-wise. To keep this training up until 1960 or 1964 Olympics was a commitment he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make. As it turned out two, younger than Rein, world class 880 yard runners were developed in Canada, shortly afterward. Bruce Kidd (currently Dean of the Faculty of Athletics, University of Toronto) won the Gold medal at the British Empire Games but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win a medal at the 1964 Olympics.  Bill Carrothers did win a silver medal at the 1964 Olympics. There are still some regrets in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind, even today, for not having tried to make the team. But it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meant to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone in our high school class graduated and we were all accepted into university at the end of the school year. Five of our classmates scored 400 points (perfect) out of 400 points in the 4 mathematics courses (Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra and Linear Algebra) on the Provincial Examinations.  Rein scored 350 out of 400, which was an average score in our class. Bob Morrison had the highest score in the school in English (i.e. higher than all the classes that were specializing in English). Rein had the highest mark in History, Lawrence Doczy (French speaking Swiss boy) in French and so forth. As a class it became our goal to have someone from our class have the highest grade in every course taught at West Hill. We of course had a whole year to practice for the examinations in grade 11 and needed to meet self-set milestones. The only course that we did not get the top grade at West Hill was in Home Economics, because Bob Japp, from our class, was refused entry into the course, which was meant \\xe2\\x80\\x9conly for girls\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. But, Bob became a PhD in soil mechanics (which involves some \\xe2\\x80\\x98cooking\\xe2\\x80\\x99) at the McGill Engineering School.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also won every intramural sport at West Hill except basketball. Shortest player on the team, Murray Waxman missed an easy lay-up shot at the end of the final game, because he was showing off. In soccer Rein of course played goalie  for the class team and held the opposing teams scoreless and scored 4 goals myself, while playing goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the West Hill High School graduation ceremony we all sat by class room number in the auditorium. Mr. Unsworth, the principal, gave the standard speech:  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 how wonderful it is \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you are standing on the launch pad of your lives \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I expect you all to do well \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he gave out certificates for prizes won in different subjects, and in intramural and interscholastic sports. Every time a member of our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoom 11D\\xe2\\x80\\x9d class received a prize, the whole class cheered and hollered. At which Mr. Unsworth hollered back saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you are being uncouth and disturbing the rest of the audience with your noise \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then subsequently, when one of our class won a prize, the whole class spontaneously stood up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very silently. At which an exasperated Mr. Unsworth said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should have known better than to tangle with the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Snobs of West Hill\\xe2\\x80\\x99, you have all done very well, and I wish you all the best at university.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Being a part of this group of students raised Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-concept and ego greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost classmates applied for entrance to McGill University. Rein was not sure what he wanted to do. His Estonian friends campaigned for him to enter McGill, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 because the Estonian soccer team needed a goalie, as probably did McGill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father wanted him to take engineering, specifically municipal engineering. Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 logic (based on 8 years of schooling) was that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 when the next world war comes, regardless of who wins, regardless who is in charge, people will continue to have \\xe2\\x80\\x98a crap\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and therefore they will always need municipal engineers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In this way, he believed, Rein would be guaranteed a job. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo Rein went into McGill Engineering and discovered that he would be, at best, the third string goalie on the McGill team. There were two older boys with much more experience ahead of him. Rein played no games for McGill, but participated in some \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriendlies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when the Estonians played exhibition games. It seemed that the Estonians were always 2 men short and usually played with only 9 men. As the Estonian goalie, Rein was usually one busy boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n1955\\r\\nWarsaw Pact Signed, \\r\\n Rosa Parks Refuses to Give Up Her Seat on a Bus in Southern U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political milieu among North Americans and especially among former refugees, like us Estonians, was that The Soviet Union/Russia was gaining an advantage in technically superior war weapons during the prevailing Cold War. As a result, a cry rose among parents that more Canadian boys should study engineering at university to close the apparently rising technology gap. Besides, from Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point of view, The Kuperjanovs wanted Rein to play goal for the McGill University Soccer team, which they all were also joining. So, for Rein there was no decision to make, it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobvious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that he should study engineering and so he enrolled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first year of McGill Engineering all students took the same set of courses, we had only one elective. Rein found the first year easy because of the advanced high school class he had been in. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work very hard. His grades dropped, but he passed. He became active in Estonian boy scouts and the Estonian church. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe boys who joined scouts, with Rein, in his Senior Scout Troop also became a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgang\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that called themselves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Kuperjanovs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. There were nine members who raised some hell in the neighbourhood, including intimidating French-Canadian boys (who returned the favour). Julius Kuperjanov was an Estonian War of Liberation hero, whom the Estonian boys admired. His legendary exploits, included leading a 1200 man battalion (that he himself had recruited and funded) and defeated both Russian and German troops in Southern Estonia. He lived from 1894 to 1919 and died before the end of the War from wounds received while bravely leading an assault in the famous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPaju Battle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The insignia of the battalion was a white skull and cross bones on a black background. We boys, as scouts, all wore a skull and crossbones on our scout uniforms and displayed it antagonistically, by turning it to face the minister Raudsepp, as he delivered the sermon. Raudsepp was obviously in a quandary and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forbid it. The boys thought they were being pretty smart and impressing the girls.\\r\\nRein also joined the Estonian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSakala\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fraternity, with well established German rituals and traditions from the University of Heidelberg, by becoming an initiate, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFox\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Rebane). Being a Sakala Fox turned out to be a good learning experience on how to drink, manners, decorum and how to behave with the opposite sex. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic father and mentor was Uno Vahtrik. It was his job to guide Rein and to make sure that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get hurt during his (expected) one year hazing as a fox. Part of the hazing in the fraternity involved drinking beer at formal meeting sessions where one had to learn proper etiquette, decorum and traditions. If a fox made a faux-pas, the punishment was to sit on the back of the chair and drink a whole mug of beer, ceremoniously. This was accompanied by a fraternity song and speeches. If the fox \\xe2\\x80\\x9cover-performed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in some manner (and was judged to be egotistical) he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9crewarded\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by being asked to sit on the back of the chair and drink a glass of beer, ceremoniously, with singing, etc. That is, the reward was the same as the punishment. The fox was taught in this manner to become a part of the social group and to give up some of his individualistid self-centeredness and crudeness. \\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus, attended our Lutheran church on most Holy days only. Rein wondered whether he did this out of habit or as a way to support our family life. One day, in downtown Montreal, on St. Catherine Street (next to the Eaton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s store), Rein spied him coming out of the impressive church that was there. Later, when Rein had gathered his courage, he asked him what he had been doing there. He replied willingly that he had done that often, not to participate in any religious rituals, but to be overwhelmed by the peace and quiet of the beautiful surroundings. He needed a quiet safe place to think, to be in touch with his inner self. Rein knew his father to be a good man, but he had never thought of him as being \\xe2\\x80\\x9creligious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Outward manifestations seldom tell the true story. Rein never violated his privacy again by trying to discuss what he believed in. The poet, T.S. Eliot, provided Rein with a personal guideline that was sufficient: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is wonderful to kneel where prayer has been valid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer Rein worked at Miss Montreal Restaurant where he was a curb waiter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnumber 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; a number that seems to have followed him around for most of his life At the Montreal Track Club he had worn \\xe2\\x80\\x9c37\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Most of the time he worked outside, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con the curb\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, serving people in cars, who came in the evening after entertainment shows downtown. Miss Montreal was the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d place, where the successful men took their girlfriends, regularly.  Rein buildt a network of people who helped him to serve his customers, and thereby make good tips (around $150 per weekend and that would be about $1100 in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money, tax free). He had made friends with the Chef who was Finnish, and bought him each day the Montreal Star newspaper which came out at 1600 in the afternoon, after the Chef was already at work. Rein always was served first by the Chef and received special help with rush orders. Rein also brought a tin of Players cigarettes periodically for the Food Checker, who monitored the bills and food that was taken out to the curb by the waiters. He checked all the bills to make sure Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a mistake that would cost him money, later. He also allowed Rein to go past his checking counter fast, without a careful check, when Rein had many customers on the curb and was rushed. He trusted Rein (and so did the Chef) and vice-versa. This was something Rein had learned from his father Romulus, while escaping around Southern Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein gave out special service calling cards, with the number10 printed on it, to his regular customers, who would put the cards behind the window wipers, before they turned their cars into the curb parking area. These became therefore Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to compete for customers with the other waiters. Rein gave them all special service, memorized their names and in some cases rushed in to get their regular order before they were even parked on the curb. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood evening Mr. Smith, and what would your guests wish to have?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would announce upon attaching the serving tray on the car window. What an ego trip for the customers, in front of their customers, friends and girlfriends. Rein learned thus to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccurb entrepreneur\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. At very busy times he would hire a personal \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbus boy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to help him, to carry out orders and to clean up after the customers who had finished. Rein thought of himself as being a self-employed businessman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut waiter number 22 made the most tips and did not work as hard as Rein. She was gorgeous, with a bountiful bust. The hardest working waiter was Walter, number 33, a central Europe immigrant, whose goal was to serve as many customers as possible (but poorly), and thereby he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make much tips. He also looked a little greasy. What a contrast, what a clear message \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a valuable first lesson in practical business behaviour that served Rein well for the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein also worked at Steinberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, helping his father on night shifts, during the school year, to unpack and price the goods for sale on the shelves, when Romulus was short of helpers.\\r\\n\\r\\n1956\\r\\nElvis Gyrates on Ed Sullivan\\'s Show \\r\\nGrace Kelly Marries Prince Rainier III of Monaco \\r\\nHungarian Revolution \\r\\nKhrushchev Denounces Stalin \\r\\nSuez Crisis \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a nationwide revolt against the government of the Hungarian People\\'s Republic and its Soviet-imposed policies, lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956. Hundreds of tanks went into Budapest and 30,000 people were killed. To flee the expected Soviet reprisals 200,000 fled to the west leaving all they possessed in Hungary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHungary in 1956 seemed to sum up all that the\\xc2\\xa0Cold War\\xc2\\xa0stood for. The people of Hungary and the rest of Eastern Europe\\xc2\\xa0were ruled over with a rod of iron by\\xc2\\xa0Communist Russia\\xc2\\xa0and anybody who challenged the rule of\\xc2\\xa0Stalin\\xc2\\xa0and Russia paid the price. The death of Stalin in 1953 did not weaken the grip Moscow had on the people of\\xc2\\xa0Eastern Europe\\xc2\\xa0and Hungary. By challenging the rule of Moscow, they paid an enormous price in 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 1956, the new Russian leader Khruschev made a bitter attack on the dead\\xc2\\xa0Stalin\\xc2\\xa0and his policies. In July 1956 a gesture was made to the Hungarians. Soviet appointed premier Rakosi was forced to resign.The Hungarians had expected more but they did not get it. This situation, combined with 1) a bad harvest 2) fuel shortages 3) a cold and wet autumn all created a volatile situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 23rd, students and workers took to the streets of Budapest and issued their Sixteen Points which included personal freedom, more food, the removal of the secret police, the removal of Russian control etc. Poland had already been granted rights in 1956 which had been gained by street protests and displays of rebellion. Hungary tried to follow such a path likewise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 31st, the newly appointed premier Nagy broadcast that Hungary would withdraw itself from the Warsaw Pact. This was pushing the Russians too far. \\xc2\\xa0November 4th, Soviet tanks went into Budapest to restore order and they acted with immense brutality even killing and wounded people.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nEndel Ruberg at the Montreal Estonian church wanted to recruit a group of young boy scouts to go to Budapest and fight against the Russians. It seemed that he was still in his mind fighting against the Russians who had conquered Estonia. He took a dozen boy scouts to the north of Montreal and tried to give them basic military training similar to what he had received some 15 years before in Estonia. Rein, as the Scoutmaster at the time warned the church people to put a stop to this self-serving behaviour of Ruberg. Rein managed to put a stop to Ruberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irresponsible behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater Lake, near Chibougamou, Quebec was the base camp for the Canadian National Railway construction crew on which Rein worked for that whole summer. The cook was a famous pastry cook, who was also an alcoholic. That was why he was forced to work \\xe2\\x80\\x9cup North\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. When Rein arrived in camp the cook had been drunk somewhere in the nearby town of Chibougamou for the past 5 days. His assistant, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCookie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, was doing his best to feed the entire camp with food that he knew how to make. Eventually a group from the camp went to Chibougamou to try and find the cook. He was brought back to the camp and sobered up. Cook had a very guilty conscience and tried to make up for his misdemeanor by cooking fantastic feasts. His pastries were of course out of this world. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery morning the cookie was sent to a trout stream at 0400 in the morning to catch \\xe2\\x80\\x9c8 inch trout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (no larger or smaller were acceptable to the cook) for breakfast. Delicious! We were also served large moose steaks. Rein was once asked whether he liked to have some apple pie, upon saying yes, he was given a whole round pie, just like everyone else. The cook would ring a triangle shaped iron rod every morning at 0700 and expected everyone at table within 5 minutes, so the food would be at its peak. We obeyed every morning, dashing to the cook house, half asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the best surveyor in camp, Rein got the job to set up a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for steam engines to turn around in at the Chibougamou railway yard. The tracks had to fit between two huge \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboulders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, without upsetting the engine. This was the first engineering job that Rein (a second year student) had ever carried out successfully. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening, Rein and his survey crew went into Chibougamou to do some drinking, and celebrating, at the Obalski Inn, run by a huge Polish owner. There was entertainment. A concert violinist performed in the middle of what seemed to be a boxing/wrestling ring that had been set up in the middle of the room. He was very talented concert violinist and played some very sad and yearning tunes. Most tough looking, burly construction and bush workers, somewhat inebriated, were in tears in response to his music. Quite an amazing theatrical scene, until the concert soloist/symphonic orchestra violinist, succumbed to his own alcoholism and passed out. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe like many others who worked in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe North\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had become shunned in civilization, for their lack of self-control when it came to alcohol. Sober workers, like engineering student Rein, were considered an anomaly and considered valuable producers of assigned work if they had even the minimum of skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein spent part of the summer working on a survey crew as chainman/rodman and walked 168 miles from Water Lake / Chibougamou to Beattyville, Quebec.  It was our task to straighten out the railway track that had been newly laid out, in a rush, by the contractor. We made sure that the trains would not get derailed going around the spiral curves of track. Every mile Rein climbed a telephone pole to nail a mileage sign indicating the distance from Chibougamou. We lived in railway cars and Rein was also the water boy and coal boy who refilled the containers in each railway car, each day. He was the lowest ranking person in the camp at the age of 19. Therefore, during the Dominion Day (July 1) weekend he was left alone to mind the camp (in the middle of nowhere), for 4 days, which seemed like months. The older members of the crew all left for the holiday.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving never been totally alone before (except with the camp dog), this was a psychologically challenging episode. Eventually Rein hallucinated and thought he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas able to hear his own thoughts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, as if they were coming from an echo chamber in his head. After a couple of days of literally sweating it out, Rein recovered control of his faculties. He spent the days reading and watching a friendly squirrel intimidating the dog who was unable to catch him between the railway car wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\n1957\\r\\nEuropean Economic Community Established \\r\\nSoviet Satellite Sputnik Launches Space Age \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first manned, globe circling manned space craft. The fears of North Americans were confirmed and everone paniced as to what could happen in the future in the cold war. Appaently there was a technology-based war weapons gap between the West and Soviet Union. Our parents were very upset.\\r\\nNovember 3, Laika, the Soviet space dog\\xc2\\xa0became the first animal to\\xc2\\xa0orbit\\xc2\\xa0the Earth. Little was known about the impact of\\xc2\\xa0spaceflight\\xc2\\xa0on living creatures at the time of Laika\\'s mission, therefore Laika\\'s survival was not expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. Laika died within hours from\\xc2\\xa0overheating, possibly caused by a failure of the central\\xc2\\xa0R-7 sustainer\\xc2\\xa0to separate hot air from the payload. On April 11, 2008, Russian officials unveiled a monument to Laika. \\r\\nThat summer Rein worked again for the Canadian National Railways.The CNR was building the railway that connected Chibougamau and St. Felicien (in the Lac St. Jean Region of Quebec), the closest city in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivilization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to us. At the Mile 66 Camp, Rein worked on a survey crew and was responsible for calculating the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccut and fill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d quantities that the contractor had moved to lay out the right-of-way for the track. This was tedious work, but Rein carried it out very conscientiously using the methods he had learned at university. One day the Chief Engineer, Mr. Horsman arrived in camp with his counterpart from the contacting company. The three of us walked the right-of-way. At every major cut or fill, the contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief engineer would stop and say that he had moved, say 100,000 cubic yards. They would argue and then Mr. Horsman would say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOK, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pay for 80,000 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Rein record that in your book\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This continued for something like a week. At the end of the right-of-way, Rein was asked to add up all of the negotiated yards and report them to Mr. Horsman. Strangely, the total number was very close to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscientific method\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein had used for the past 6 months. Another lesson was learned.\\r\\nOnce again all the workers were all granted a long weekend and Rein was left alone to watch the camp and to feed the half a dozen dogs. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite dog was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNicky\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a black, somewhat anxious Scottie.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein kept in touch with other camps along the partially completed railway grade by two-way radio. Bored, he decided to go and visit his nearby (30 kilometers) friends at the closest camp. The camp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Land Rover Jeep had been drained of gasoline by the camp chief, so that it would not be stolen at night. Rein siphoned some gasoline into a can and filled up the tank of the vehicle. He loaded all 6 dogs in the back and headed off along the railway grade, never having driven an automobile in his life before. The bumpy and rutted road made the Land Rover pitch and shake. Nicky became quite alarmed and tried to climb into Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lap. Holding on to the steering wheel with one hand, Rein tried to push Nicky off his lap. In doing this the jeep went out of control and headed down a very high embankment of the railway fill. Halfway down the 20 foot high embankment was a huge boulder and we hit it head on. The Land Rover sommersaulted head over heals through the air and landed on its wheels, breaking the underbody of the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogs had literally been airborne during this accident, jumped out the open broken window and raced whining and barking back towards the Camp. Rein was in shock, but had the sense to turn off the engine which was hissing and making a horrible sound. He sat there wondering whether he was injured. The week before a construction worker had driven a pick-up truck off the main highway in an accident. He had tried to walk to the nearest camp for help, but died from internal bleeding. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I bleeding internally?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein wondered in panic. He walked back to Camp 66 and spoke on the radio to his friends at other camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the camp chief came back from his long weekend, he was less than pleased to hear about what had happened to his vehicle. Rein was driven to St. Felicien to meet the Chief Engineer, Mr. Horsman. In a bunk house, that had been turned into an office, he lectured Rein in a loud voice. There were walls between rooms, but the walls did not reach to the ceiling. Every word that was said was heard by other people in the building, some of whom were fellow engineering students of Rein. We all knew each other well and Rein had the reputation of being \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca smart-ass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and good with excuses for getting out of trouble in the past. The students later reported that everyone held their breath to hear how Rein would reply to Mr. Horsman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tirade. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you going to do about the Land Rover, which is government property, and which you destroyed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d eventually, Mr. Horsman shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Rein replied, playing the sympathy card, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI admit I have done wrong and I apologize. I also know that you have a son my age who will be going to university, studying engineering. If you make me pay for the Land Rover, I will never be able to become an engineer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Silence seemingly lasted a very long time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet the hell out of here, I do not want to see you again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you are FIRED!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Horsman roared. The students in the adjoining rooms burst into applause \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation as a man with the gift of gab had saved him well, again. But he was now fired, a relatively small price to pay for his misdemeanor. Rein gladly took the work train back to Montreal, a bit more mature and thankful for escaping with his life, in more ways than one.\\r\\n \\r\\nAt McGill University Rein finally decided to try and study Civil Engineering (after previously trying and rejecting Architecture, Mining and Metallurgy). He decided to specialize in soil mechanics and municipal engineering, like his father wished.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued to play table tennis. At the International YMCA they held a round table competition. That is, after playing a point the loser would have to go back into a line to wait for another turn. Rein played the best table tennis of his life. He went undefeated for 5 hours. A local radio station turned up to report on this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwonder kid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein also won McGill University Table Tennis Championship. He was asked to represent McGill at the Montreal city championships. These were held in a huge hall, the Montreal (hockey) Forum. Place was filled with thousands of spectators and competitors. The first two opponents that Rein drew were Chinese. They had a very different style. They held their bat like a spoon and they had bats with foam rubber covers. This totally unnerved Rein and he lost badly to both opponents, to the disappointment of watching McGillians. This was the end of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s competitive table tennis career.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein became part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeatnics in-crowd\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. All this was supposedly a reaction to the post Second World War rampant consumerism of the adults, perceived cynically by our generation about to enter adulthood. We saw society as corrupt, insincere, materialistic and unprincipled. Perhaps (as an afterthought) it was a typical revolt of those who were growing up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe imitated what we thought would be the life on the banks of the Riviere (or Rive) Gauche in Paris and in other European cities, where creativity and art flourished after the War. Rein took to wearing an Ascot, corduroy jackets that reached almost to the knees and moccasins. A beret was optional. Around the McGill University campus coffee shops sprang up: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPam-Pam\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeplace Else\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTokay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaf\\xc3\\xa9 Des Artistes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, etc. An Ascot and moccasins have survived as a standard uniform. The beret has become a Greek fisherman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hat. A shorter corduroy jacket hangs in the closet.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein participated in protracted philosophical debates at the Cafes, drinking tea from green ceramic tea pots. The longest debate, still remembered, was at Pam-Pam lasting 4 hours with a Dr. Panda, a bearded Sikh, who dated one of the Estonian girls. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there a God?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After 4 hours it ended with Rein being challenged by Dr. Panda that Rein was afraid that Dr. Panda would prove that there was no God. Rein replied that the he was no more worried than Dr. Panda was that Rein would prove that there was a God. A gathering of some 30 people who had gathered around our table at the caf\\xc3\\xa9, gave us an applause that relieved the tension. It was declared a tie.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein also read (performed) poetry at a coffee House called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome Place Else\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Sitting on a high stool, with a candle burning under it, in a semi-dark room, he recited T.S. Eliot, from memory. The Waste Land poem was at the time of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cde rigeur\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\rApril is the cruelest month,\\r\\nLilacs out of the dead land, \\r\\nMemory and desire, stirring\\r\\nDull roots with spring rain.\\r\\nWinter kept us warm, covering\\r\\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\\r\\nA little life with dried tubers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, the young man carbuncular, arrives,   \\r\\nA small house agent\\'s clerk, with one bold stare,   \\r\\nOne of the low on whom assurance sits   \\r\\nAs a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.   \\r\\nThe time is now propitious, as he guesses,  \\r\\nThe meal is ended, she is bored and tired,   \\r\\nEndeavours to engage her in caresses   \\r\\nWhich still are unreproved, if undesired.   \\r\\nFlushed and decided, he assaults at once;   \\r\\nExploring hands encounter no defense;  \\r\\nHis vanity requires no response,   \\r\\nAnd makes a welcome of indifference. \\r\\n  \\r\\n(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all   \\r\\nEnacted on this same divan or bed;   \\r\\nI who have sat by Thebes below the wall  \\r\\nAnd walked among the lowest of the dead.)   \\r\\n\\r\\nBestows one final patronising kiss,   \\r\\nAnd gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit...\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turns and looks a moment in the glass,   \\r\\nHardly aware of her departed lover;  \\r\\nHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:   \\r\\n\\'Well now that\\'s done: and I\\'m glad it\\'s over.\\'   \\r\\nWhen a lovely woman stoops to folly and   \\r\\nPaces about her room again, alone,   \\r\\nShe smoothes her hair with automatic hand,  \\r\\n... And puts a record on the gramophone.\\r\\n     \\r\\nT.S. Eliot was a product of our time. The Waste Land was a poem that he wrote as a memorial to the dead of the First World War in 1922. Before the War, most people in the world had blindly believed that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat War\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWar to End All Wars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWild Twenties\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1920\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) followed and all lessons from the First World War were soon forgotten. Until the 1940\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, when the Second World War was fought again by largely the same opponents. I guess we (in Montreal) as draft eligible males, in our early twenties felt vulnerable for another repeat of history, that is, a Third World War. We found it easy to relate to Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLilacs in the spring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (growing in Europe on World War graves), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cApril being the cruelest month\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (when most of the men died) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWinter kept us warm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (soldiers in their graves), are in The Wasteland poem. Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mockery of the euphoric celebration of the dead after the War was meaningful. He was referring especially to those in the previous generation who had avoided getting drafted into the War, but had sent young boys to their cruel death. The poem was a vitriolic rebuke of the apathy, vulgarity and moral shambles of the postwar years. Rein still finds the poem, painfully, appropriate today.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein, as the Scoutmaster, met Mari, who was the Cubmaster, at the St. John Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. The teenage boys in the scouts were a real handful to keep under control. That is why Rein was made Scoutmaster. Rein bought a set of equipment to play ring hockey (similar to hockey, except the puck was a soft material ring and the sticks had no blade). The smallest boy became one of the goalies (against the wishes of his mother who was overly protective). He was one happy kid to be playing rough and tumble with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig\\xe2\\x80\\x9d boys. He got bruised up quite a bit, but never complained, nor did his mother. Rein had to several times bind up his wounds and discovered that he, himself, was not very good at dealing with other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blood (because of over-sympathy) and almost passed out. The boys as a group became more manageable and even some scouting lessons were held successfully. Two years later, at a summer outing for the Estonian community, at Pruuli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s farm, four of the rowdy scout boys surprised Rein by having organized a band and played music to the crowd gathered. They were very complimentary towards Rein for \\xe2\\x80\\x9chaving brought them together as Scouts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the boys were playing ring hockey, Rein would sneak a peek at what the cubs and their blonde leader were doing. She out-ranked me being a Gilwell Scout (like a PhD in scouting). I was a lowly third class scout, but supposedly tough enough to handle testosterone, of the so called bunch of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chooligans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. One day Mari came over to the Scout side, out of uniform, wearing a tight white hairy sweater, just like Marilyn Monroe: 36-24-36. Apparently her scout uniform was at the dry cleaners. Rein noticed. WOW!\\r\\n\\r\\nRein became lead male dancer of the Montreal Estonian National Dance Group. His claim to fame was an ability, using strong-arm methods, to get male dancers to join the group and to turn up at performances. There were at least 3 girls for every boy. Mari was one of the girls who apparentlywas waiting for her turn to become Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dance partner. Rein danced with an older girl, beautiful Toini Troon for several years. She was an excellent dancer and knew all the steps and routines better than Rein. She was also very patient with Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bravado and high jinxs which the audience liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assumed dancing style and role became that of an Estonian peasant farm boy, because he was always being yanked back into the correct step or routine by Toini, to the great amusement of the audience. Eventually in response to audience approval, Rein, in self defense, started acting the part of a dull peasant farm boy, dancing with a very beautiful maiden. This eventually became a part of our act, even when Rein knew the routine. The audience\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Wedding Polka\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (The Tuljak in Estonian). After acting as the peasant boy, Rein completed the routine as a madly in love boy who actually learned how to dance quite well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the Tuljak the boys had to lift the girls up above their shoulders, to great applause from the audience. I remember that my good friend Jaan Liiva, had once the misfortune of having a dance partner who was somewhat on the heavy side. Several times he failed trying to lift her weight and finally both of them landed on the dance floor in a heap. The audience thought it was a part of the act \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and Jaan stole the starring role from Rein, that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the young and older members of the Montreal Estonian Community used to go to twice monthly dances. With a live band and usually a singer and comic, these were often held at the large Westmount Hall. Invariably, maybe an hour into the festivities, some older gentleman, usually, would start banging their foot on the floor. Bang! Bang! Bang! Others would join him and the sound would drown out the musicians. This was the signal for the Estonian National Dance Group to perform, spontaneously. The dancers present, would remain in their seats. With the dance floor empty and the stamping and shouts of the audience for the folk dancers to perform, Rein was expected to come to the middle of the floor and signal to as many dancers of the group, who were in attendance, to come on the floor. At the same time, the musicians would get their accordions on (often other musicians from the audience would join them with their accordions). Rein recalls that one occasion there were 5 excellent accordion players at play. We would do our popular act to the sound of very familiar Estonian folk tunes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nostalgia, especially for the older folk, I guess. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe always ended with the Tuljak, but had to dance a few encores to the enthusiastic demands of the audience. Before sitting down, the members of the dance group went into the audience and the girls invited older gentlemen and the boys older ladies to come and dance with them (to some of the simpler tunes). This was wildly popular and it was always impressive how well many of the older folk knew their heritage and dance routines. This was the closest to being a part of \\xe2\\x80\\x9can Estonian community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that Rein had ever experienced in his life to that date.\\r\\n\\r\\n1958\\r\\n\\r\\nBoris Pasternak Refuses Nobel Prize \\r\\nChinese Leader Mao Zedong Launches the \"Great Leap Forward\" \\r\\nLEGO Toy Bricks First Introduced \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third year of civil engineering the classroom lectures became much more specialized and we also spent one month, every year, at Survey Camp in the woods around St.Gabriel de Brandon, Quebec, learning how to do measurements in geodesy and astronomy (surveying).\\r\\n\\r\\nA regular attendee at the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church on Marcil Avenue in Notre Dame de Grace, Rein became the informal leader of the young people attending church. Rein was approached by Rev. Karl Raudsepp, who became eventually a Bishop, to consider becoming a minister in the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Rein probably was transmitting some uncertainty about his engineering studies. After some thinking about such and alternative, Rein rejected the offer. Although he was very involved with Christianity and church, Rein could not see himself becoming a minister in an ethnic church. Such a responsibility involved delivering political sermons, condemning the Communists who had visciously attacked Estonia, along with interpreting the Bible. Rev. Raudsepp\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer was accepted by T\\xc3\\xb5nis Nommik, a friend, who eventually became the most senior pastor in the newly independent Estonian Armed Forces. He moved his family to Estonia. Something Rein was also not willing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of his earnings, working each summer in Northern Quebec and working after school, he became a favourite of the girls and dated many of them. He also had the reputation of being a good dancer, especially the Viennese Walse, the Jitter-bug and of course the Polka. Rein and his partners won several dance competitions. This included a very memorable Jitterbug contest, with Mari, at of all places in a Polish Hall, in a less than civilized area of the city. Rein had been drinking, perhaps more than was good for him. This made him very subtle and fast on his feet. The style of the time was dancing the Jitterbug as if your legs were made of plastic/rubber. The booze had made Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legs indeed rubbery and plastic. The MC announced that we had won and invited us to the front of the orchestra. When the MC discovered that we were not Polish, the MC decided to call it a tie and invited a Polish couple to join us as winners. We had no idea what they were saying and Rein doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to this day remember how we ended up at the Polish Hall. Our prize was a clay/porcelain ash tray.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the greatest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvictory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dancing career occurred as a result of a dare by some of his fellow mates and in response to a boast made by Rein. Rein boasted that he could date, and take out dancing 12 girls, he had never dated before, during a 30 day (one month) period. This boast obviously was during one of the many beer drinking bouts we held at Mansfield Tavern on McGill College Avenue, near the university.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve this goal, Rein recruited some help from his girlfriends whom he had dated or knew from the church, previously. Most of the girls thought that this was a fun \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgig\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In the 1950\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, especially in an Estonian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvillage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d environment, dating between late teens, early twenties, boys and girls was more sexual or \\xe2\\x80\\x9chunting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a husband or wife. At least, this was so in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind and actions. Rein was in no hurry to get sexually involved or seek a candidate for wife. After dating 10 girls by the last weekend of the month, Rein was in a bit of a quandary. He asked Marju Ilves for a date, and as chance would have it, her girlfriend Marika Salamis was also in need of a date. She invited both of us to attend the Hellenic Ball at The Ritz-Carlton Hotel, one of the fanciest in the city. Apparently her father was the Greek Archbishop of Montreal. We arrived at the Ball and were announced to the audience in the Ballroom, by a doorman dressed in some sort of Greek \\r\\nperiod dress. Most people were announced as couples. But in our case he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnnouncing Miss Marika Salamis and Miss Marju Ilves with Rein Peterson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This caused a bit of a stir in the room and it went directly into Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overblown male ego.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the festivities started, a go-between arrived at our table and announced that Mrs. Salamis, the Archbishop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife, would be pleased if Rein asked her to dance the first, opening walse with her. Marika explained that her father was not well and unable to dance the opening walse to start the festivities. Rein approached the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthrone podium\\xe2\\x80\\x9d set up at the front of the Ballroom, he bowed ceremoniously and asked the lady for a dance. She was quite large in the midrift, with a very fancy \\xe2\\x80\\x9croyal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dress that extended to the floor. She turned out to be a very good dancer. We twirled around the room, to her great pleasure, especially when Rein would take them close to the tables that circled the ballroom. The tail of her dress would be flowing like a flag higher off the ground and we swept as many glasses off the tables of the unsuspecting people as possible. A lot of merriment and shouts of joy followed. That evening Rein was one busy boy, dancing with Marika and Marju, Madame Salamis and other older ladies who sent representatives to our table, requesting a dance. WOW!\\r\\n\\r\\nGood time was had by all. But the most important achievement was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dating 12 girls during the month as Rein had boasted. What a victory! Every 20 year old boy needs such a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvictory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It is important to understand that the Estonian community was like a little village, back in Estonia. Everyone knew everyone else. We all attended church together and participated in various clubs and organizations. Regularly we all met for a large \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvillage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dance at Westmount Hall. Boys and girls often went to such events without dates, to meet each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer Rein was hired by the Quebec Cartier Mining Company and flew to Seven Islands. At the airport he boarded a company Canso float plane, full of oil drums, among which he sat with his duffel bags. We flew to Lac Jeannine, the location of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s base exploration camp. Having never flown in a Canso float plane before, Rein received a major scare when upon landing, the float plane submerged and then bopped up upon the surface of the lake. We were met on the dock by a large black wolf like dog, who jumped upon the passangers exiting the aeroplane. When the dog jumped on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chest, he instinctively hit the dog behind his ear, with the back of his fist, knocking the dog into the water. A stunned \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNapoleon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d met Rein at the end of the dock and we became instant friends. Rein was still hung over from drinking at the airport and the up and down bobbing of the airplane. He was in no mood to be bullied by a dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nNapoleon, adopted Rein for the summer. Apparently he was the top male dog in the camp, and during the winter apparently served as the lead dog of a sled team. Napoleon had a girlfriend, Josephine, by name of course. She had much more wolf in her, smaller, with eyes that were closer together, her gait was wolf-like, but a rather small vertical streak of white hair on her chest betrayed her as a dog. Napoleon took to sleeping on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bunk bed and would grumble when forced to sleep beside the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Temps, a senior engineer, was in charge of the Lac Jeannine camp, which consisted of many tents and recently built barrack type quarters. Temps decided, next morning, to test the surveying skills of the gathered new recruits. We were each assigned a portion of the camp and we were asked to do a timed stadia survey of an asssigned portion. The idea was to take sightings of surveying poles, placed at corners of tents and other targets, and to record the distance and angle of as many readings, as possible, from a base line, until a whistle blew. Later we had to use our survey readings to draw maps of our portion of the camp the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt turned out that three of us were judged to have shown a high level of surveying skill. Rein had taken 3 more stadia shots than Robert Temps. Mr. Temps was very proud of his own skill and speed of doing stadia surveys. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe three winners were appointed camp leaders of new future exploration sites. Rein was assigned Luck Lake, LeJourneau, a friend, who eventually became the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief mining engineer, was given Fire Lake and a third engineering student was asked to survey Mount Reed/Mount Wright. As it turned out, iron ore was eventually discovered at Fire Lake and Mount Reed/Mount Wright. Luck Lake, upon test drilling, proved to have an insufficient grade of iron ore and was abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile at Lac Jeannine, Rein was asked to serve temporarily as acting safety and industrial engineer (in his moccasins) of the open-pit mine which was just starting up. During dynamite blasts, placed in deep drilled holes, it was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job to make sure that the open-pit mine was cleared of all personnel. He proved to be a bit too adventurous himself and several times had narrow escapes from blasts, jumping into the buckets of large tracked motorized shovels.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was also asked to determine the possible rate of drilling in the open-pit mine, in terms of feet drilled per hour. The men were then paid so many dollars per foot drilled per day. Standing in the cab of a huge drilling machine, Rein carefully observed the steps used by the crew and time studied each component to determine a standard time. The men were not pleased with having a young engineering student measuring their time elements and determining their pay. Na\\xc3\\xafve Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the work crew added several unnecessary movvements to their drilling routine, to achieve a longer drilling standard from the time study. Each hole drilled (for placement of dynamite) was about 40 feet deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile drilling a hole and pulling up the drill bit, for a sharper one, the hole collapsed at about 10 feet from surface. Try as they might the crew failed to retrieve the stuck pit. This meant that the crew would not get paid for the drilling of that hole. Rein, being quite slim, light and atheletic, at the time, volunteered to be lowered, with ropes tied around his feet, head first into the hole. Ultimately he wrapped his arms around the bit and was pulled out of the hole with the retrieved bit. Needless to say, the men were more than pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey eventually admitted that they had fooled Rein with their standard work motion sequence and then helped him to determine a fair \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnegotiated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d standard rate for their drilling. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were eventually flown to Tuttle Lake, the main interim exploration camp. During our stay at Tuttle Lake we documented some of the local topography and lakes by surveying from Government maps. Boys will be boys, though. We decided to officially name a group of unnamed lakes: Lowbal, Hibal, Nobal and Cocnbal. Cocnbal had a distinctive feature which pointed approximately North. We determined the exact bearing and released it to the pilots.This lake became popular with bushpilots, because of this prominent, approximate, on ground pointing feature. All pilots were navigating visually, and appreciated getting confirmation of their heading, when taking off from the lake.We had to convince some Quebec government officials, en francais, that the names were of Indian origin, from a tribe that hunted in the region. Thus, history is made, we supposed.\\r\\nRein was also responsible for the local weather recording instruments. On June 5, 1957 it snowed at Tuttle Lake. The Montreal bureaucrats did not believe Rein. We, who were living in the tents had no doubt about the temperature. To keep warm we heated a stove concocted out of an old oil drum. We would fill the stove with wood and oil residue. The stove would turn reddish and the access lid on top of the drum would start to make a clatter, increasingly fast, as if the drum was going to explode. We were in an overheated de-facto sauna. We would play chicken, as to who would be the last to storm out of the tent. We would return to the tent and repeat the process when the drum had cooled down. Fortunately there were no casualties. The words of Rev. Raudsepp, in Montreal, came to mind: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGod protects those who do not have the ability, and the sense, to protect themselves!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thank God!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bushmen would test Rein (as the new Luck Lake camp boss) by using their canoes to cross the wide Tuttle Lake to the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work sites. They would sit on the very end of their canoes, with the bow pointing about 80 degrees to the sky, and they would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknife\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their way through the water at a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbreakneck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d speed. Rein would be left behind, to bring the necessary equipment and personal effects in a large \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfreighter canoe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, with a small outboard motor and Rein was a scared, inexperienced helmsman. They would push Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freighter into the water and then jump into their own faster canoes, and and would always arrive first, and pull Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s canoe onto the shore on the other side. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terror started to subside on the third trip across the lake. But the waves on the relatively wide lake did not ever subside.  Rein was not a good swimmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bush pilots on weekends used to engage in pretend duels in the sky, which Rein managed to avoid. Rein stayed at Tuttle Lake several times and after his tenure at Luck Lake was told by Temps that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are jinxed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given you some of the most likely sites where iron ore could be found. To date you have found F-all!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As a result Rein was assigned to work out of the main office at the mine site at Lac Jeannine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seemed at the time as being demoted to a desk job. Hurt, Rein retorted by blurting out that, to date, iron ore had been found, only, at Lakes named after Seven Island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prostitutes. US Steel Corporation, the owner of Quebec Cartier Mining Corporation, senior executives, like Tuttle, and others, had yielded no ore. Several years later, Rein found out that iron ore had actually been discovered at Fire Lake and Mount Reed/Mount Wright, named after relatively lowly bureaucratic accountants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at our assigned Luck Lake campsite, we discovered that it was a fly and mosquito-laden swampy bay. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLuck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lake was someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea of a sense of humour. First thing we did was find a suitable tree to hoist our radio atenna onto to hook up our small battery operated portable radio unit, with the call signal CJP - 260 and we reported in to headquartes at Tuttle Lake. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCJP - 260, Luck Lake Radio\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was now on the airwaves. All air traffic, it turned out was usually monitored by a housewife in the Town of Sept Isles. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe cleared a wind slash across a small area of land jutting out into the Lake, to provide some air circulation across our chosen camp site and to hopefully discourage fly/mosquito infestations. Old Joseph located the outhouse, critically downwind, with a deep, dug trench, and lined around by logs that served as the toilet seats for our posteriors. Use of Lime was a mixed blessing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA younger engineering student, Andy, had been assigned to Rein to help with the surveying. Of Greek origin, he was a total novice when it came to living in the bush. His balance on a trench \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in the latrine, was always precarious, a terror to him and an adeventure to us all. What if \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 ?\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivilization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in November, 2007, the Quebec newspaper, Le Devoir, published an article urging the Quebecois citizens not to forget their long history and traditions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReturn to Your Own Roots? Raise the importance of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Qu\\xc3\\xa9becitude\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This would help the Qu\\xc3\\xa9be\\xc3\\xa7ois to find their identity, separate from the English-speaking people around them. Bryan Perro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCr\\xc3\\xa9atures Fantastiques du Qu\\xc3\\xa9bec\\xe2\\x80\\x9d described a rich vein of super-natural French-Canadian history that had been preserved in stories around rural kitchen tables, lumber and mining camps and were told on cold and stormy nights. Lumberjacks, bushmen and others were reported to choose work camps to join, based on the quality of storytellers in their midst. Rein experienced this aspect of Quebec culture personally.\\r\\n\\r\\nMythological stories were, in fact, told in our Northern Quebec survey camps, late in the late 1950s. Rein spent 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 months per summer, for 2 years living in tents, in isolated self-constructed crude camps, built with half-breed French Canadians and aboriginals, in the very North of Quebec. We were seeking iron ore near the tree line of Quebec. Given the culture among the French-Canadian-Acadian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbushmen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, who were the dominant group in each camp, stories of werewolf legends and spirits became very believable (including to Rein). \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo legends remain in memory -- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Loup-Garou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a chopping spirit among the trees (whose name Rein cannot remember).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Loup-Garou was believed to be a man condemned to be turned into a wolf (a werewolf), because he failed to observe the requisite period of penitence in preparation for Easter (a most important date in the Quebec Catholic calendar). The man was doomed to wander the countryside in animal form, saved only if someone recognized him and drew some blood from him. Neither one of the two, in such a case, was allowed to speak about this transformation from human to animal and back. This legend was believed to have travelled to Qu\\xc3\\xa9bec with settlers from France in the 17-th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our camps, especially at the Luck Lake camp, wehre Rein served as the only \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, we had evidence of a Loup Garou. We could hear a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoup-Garou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d howling in the forest all around us, at dusk. We also heard the sound of a legendary man, who seemed to be blazing a trail with an axe, obviously trying to esacape being lost. The howling sound and the sound of the axe were very seductive and there were many stories of men wondering off into the bush, alone, in search of the lost axeman and/or the eerie, seductive, somehow welcoming, sorrowful howl of the wolf. Rein could feel this urge too. On several occasions groups of us went off into the forest to look for two branches that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobviously\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must have been striking together and thus making the chopping sound of an axeman. The howling was believed by some of us to be the wind. We were never able to find any evidence to explain either of these phenomena. So we all became to believe in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoup-Garou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and we warned everyone not to wonder off into the woods during the night in pursuit of the very real, magnetic, yearning within ourselves. Rein still can imagine the sound of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoup-Garou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVieux\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Joseph (Old Joseph), who was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead hand in the camp, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in the Loup-Garou myth. He explained it as being a story that warned bush-men not to go off into the bush alone, especially after dark. If they did for some reason go, they should must always blaze a very clear path so that they could find their way back to camp. It was a constant reminder, that we were all alone in the bush, some 500 miles in the middle of nowhere, far away from any other safe habitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother memory remains incomplete. Rein recalls being out in the bush surveying, with the bush-men cutting straight sight lines through the trees and under-bush, so that Rein could take measurements with his transit/theodilite. We had been working very hard that day, rushing to get back to camp. One of the bushmen struck a tree with his axe and it carommed unexpectedly and struck him in the shin , causing a deep wound. The tree had been petrified by a previous fire in the forest and was as solid as rock. Other bush-men quickly put on a turnaquet and strung his leg up a tree branch to stop the flow of bleeding. They also used some plants from the forest as medication. Old Joseph immediately ordered all the men to stop working, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause we had offended the spirit of the trees\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Joseph was from New Brunswick and had some native Indian blood in him apparently. He counseled that someone must run to a survey camp that happened, by chance, to be nearby (some 5 kilometers away) and get a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmedicine man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that he knew would be there, and that he could stop the bleeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the day, a medicine man indeed arrived, he seemed to chant some spells and use some herbs and we lowered the man from the tree and his bleeding had stopped. Rein saw all this with his own eyes. Rein was able to radio base camp via \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCJP- 260 Luck Lake radio\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and get a Beaver float plane to come to our camp lake location and transport the injured man to hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Joseph may have not believed in the Loup-Garou, but he certainly had his own set of super-natural beliefs that he followed. Rein, for his part, was cautious about respecting the beliefs and rituals of all people who had lived in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbush\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for decades and had access to other realities than our own Judeo-Christian,Western world view. Old Joseph was always Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentor and he chose all the crew members for Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s camps, once we received our manpower allocation and destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nFishing was the major sport for the Bushmen every day. Rein remembers the very large Luck Lake pike that many of the men had failed to hook and catch, for weeks. Many clever planned strategies were planned, but failed. One morning around 0500 Rein woke and went for a walk by the lake. The big lake pike was jumping in and out of the water, not too far away. Rein had never fished or cast a line before in his life. But, he grabbed the nearest fishing pole, leaning against a tree. He went to the end of the long dock and cast (clumsily) the line towards where the fish was jumping. The fish became hooked, suddenly, and Rein discovered that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to reel it in. Shouting with glee and for help, he woke up the whole camp. Old Joseph shouted at Rein not to pull too hard on the line, because it was not strong enough for such a big fish, which kept on jumping in and out of the water. A single gunshot from Old Joseph hit the fish and Rein was able to reel in the dead fish. It was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prize catch of that summer. But all the Bushmen were angry and jealous. To shoot a fish in the water was considered very \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgouche, moudit Anglais\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trophy fish was 26 inches long and was hung vertically from a high branch of a tree. The plan was to eat the fish for supper next day. That night, Andy, my tent mate woke me up saying that a bear was sniffing around his face through the tent canvas. I told him that was nonsense and told him to go to sleep. What could we do if there was a bear outside the tent. It was best to stay quiet and motionless in our sleeping bags.In the morning we discovered that our trophy fish had been eaten, halfway up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bushmen were a boisterous group and half of them were homosextual. With Old Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help Rein was able to locate all the homosextuals in their own tents, separate from the other men. This was much appreciated by all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSex turned out to be also on the mind of Andy, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s young assistant. One day Andy started to complain about the pain in his penis. The pain and complaining reached a crescendo. Rein decided to try and get help from the radio monitor in Seven Islands and called her on CJP \\xe2\\x80\\x93 260 Luck Lake Radio. Eventually, a doctor came on the radio. Andy admitted that he had visited a prostitute in Seven Islands on his way to our camp. The doctor then asked Rein to describe how the penis looked like. Andy couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, so Rein had to describe the swollen member on open radio. Every camp in our surroundings heard this and considered it the best entertainment of the summer. Catcalls of all sorts came over the airwaves from almost all of the other camps.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeterson, what the f--- are you guys doing over there anyway?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The doctor decided it was gonorrhea. A float plane picked up Andy next day and brought him to hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurveying around Luck Lake involved tremendous amount of self control, because the large amount of mosquitoes and especially the black flies that always circled your face. Actually, the black flies were the worst. Being very small they could burrow themselves through your clothes and get to your skin. We used a lot of oil repellent, P-26, to no avail. The Bushmen seemed to be less bothered by bugs, partly because they seldom washed themselves and were always somewhat odorous.  Rein eventually took example, and reduced the number of baths and he made \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca pact with the black flies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bite me I will not kill you. It was a mind game of self control, but it seemed to work. \\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a theodolite sight involved setting up the instrument on marshy, soft ground. You had to balance the bubble on the instrument using your two feet and while maintaining your exact balance, take readings until the location of the survey line was established some hundereds of feet ahead of you, by your assistant and a bushman armed with an axe. Holding your breath seemed to help. It was amazing what the Bushmen could do with their axe. They often carved wooden survey stations that looked like concrete posts, one after another, on the Base Line, which acted as our main street.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring that summer we walked single file to a new survey site. Rein always carried his own heavy Theodolite survey instrument and a big backpack. He made the mistake of walking with his head down, following the man directly ahead of him. He was not keeping track of which way or direction we were walking. The Bushmen decided to play a trick on Rein and they all quickly dispersed into the bush on all sides. Rein, eventually realized that he was walking alone, and lost. He kept on walking and walking. Eventually the Bushmen decided that the joke was over and decided to come back and find Rein. They called out to Rein.  But Rein, a bit angry and embarrassed, decided to hide in the underbush from the searchers, they eventually gave up and went back to the camp. Rein decided to find his own way back, but failed to figure out the direction. It was getting dark, so Rein bedded down for the night. He did not want to commit the error of walking around in circles, which is easy to do, in the dark, when you are lost. \\r\\n\\r\\nEarly next morning he resumed his search for the camp. On top of every hill, the surroundings offered no clue as to where he was. Every direction was a green mass of trees and undergrowth. The compass on the Theodolite would not work because we were in an area that had iron anomalies everywhere. Eventually, by accident, he came across one of his own picket survey lines. All picket survey lines ran back to the main Base Line (Our Main Street), which was well marked. This resulted in a rather startling insight. A line goes in two directions. So, which way should he turn? He resorted to saying that politically he always tried to turn to the right. By a fluke he was right. Eventually the picket line did lead him to the base line and Rein was able to get back to the camp. All the Bushmen had left the camp in search of Rein. This, that is \\xe2\\x80\\x9close\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their boss, could be a bit of an embarrassment for them, Rein lay down in his tent and had a nap. He was awakened by the returning  Bushmen and a very happy old Joseph. Egotistically, Rein felt triumphant and the episode was never spoken about again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter returning to Montreal, that summer, Rein was invited to cub scout camp by Mari, to help out. All the male scout leaders set up their tents according to the instructions in the Scout Handbook. Rein set up Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and his own tent in the way he had learned up North, from the Bushmen. The idea was to build the tent on a slight incline of ground and to cut big branches which were then used as logs onto which he nailed the frame holding up the camp beds. The Boy Scout nerds did not do this and set up their tents on level ground and then dug relatively shall ditches all around the tents. It started to rain hard, and all of their camp tent floors became soggy and muddy, because they became like water collecting ponds. The camp was evacuated and the children were bedded down in the nearby cook house and eating hall which had a real roof. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tents were not soggy because the water flowed right through the tent after the sides of the tents were rolled up. As a civil engineer and as a prospector, Rein had learned that you do not fight water--- all you can do is steer it where it wants to go anyway. Rein slept comfortably in his tent through the storm that night (as he had done on several occasions while camping as a prospector, up north).\\r\\n\\r\\n1959\\r\\nCastro Becomes Dictator of Cuba \\r\\nInternational Treaty Makes Antarctica Scientific Preserve \\r\\nKitchen Debate Between Nixon and Khrushchev \\r\\n\\r\\nRein dated Tiiu Kuhi and they had long discussions and debates about the anxieties of what had happened in their personal lives and what their future lives could become. Tiiu always set the mood, being the more intellectual and classy. Rein was very much attracted to Tiiu, trying to impress the beautiful young woman with his stories and accomplishments. In fact, he felt a little intimidated, like a mosquito attracted to a bright light bulb. Rein had grown up, mostly alone, in a male environment that had not given much opportunity to develop his social skills. He grew up with very few females.\\r\\nRein learned from Tiiu about the paintings of Paul Gaugain, that Tiiu admired, and she knew how to bewitch an engineering student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in the arts, that remained attached to him for the rest of his life. On a trip to Tahiti Rein and Mari visited Gaugain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home/hut in Mataica Village and visited his grave at Autona Hiva Oa, Cimetiere Calvaire. A valuable sample of his original paintings was displayed in a poorly kept damp gallery and deterirating. It was a sad sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Tiiu and Rein were a little depressed about what was going on in the world, as they sipped caf\\xc3\\xa9-au-lait at the Caf\\xc3\\xa9 des Artists on Dorchester Street, near the CBC Building.They were both in their early twenty years. Rein was becoming enamoured in the young lady, always prim and proper, and very assured of herself. Inexperienced Rein felt for his part a little gauche.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went on picnics and one time Tiiu insisted on riding a huge working horse that bucked up, with Rein holding on to its leash.We both paniced. At least Rein did. Fortunately the horse calmed down and we were able to continue. What a brave or foolish girl?\\r\\n\\r\\nTiiu lived at Lakeside, a Montreal suburb, that could be only reached if Rein or Tiiu took a commuter train (at specific hours) or a non-city bus. It was terra incognita for Rein, who had no automobile.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein won a competition to become the Director of one of the survey camps of the McGill University Survey School. This was his first teaching position. The camps were run at St. Gabriel de Brandon, North of Montreal. He became responsible for training 80 engineering students and supervising 8 (classmate) student instructors. Twelve of the students were female architects.\\r\\n\\r\\nInexperienced, he ran the camp like a strict staff seargent (not knowing any better), barking orders every morning at row call, assigning everyone their roles and assignments for the day. Rein was clearly the best surveyor in camp (because of his work experience in Northern Quebec survey camps). He tended to show off his surveying skills and thereby won respect and legitimacy from the students as Director of the camp. There were two other similar camps in town and a natural urge to compete between them arose. Because of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, surveying skills and setting very tough exercises, we were eventually accepted as the toughest and best camp. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, at roll call, only about 50% of the students and instructors had turned up at the assigned 0800. Rein marked them all late. One of the students pointed out that Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s watch was running fast and that it was only 0745 (which Rein discovered later to be the case). Full of himself, Rein responded by shouting that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis camp runs on Peterson time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. From then on, every time during the day, when he was walking from one exercise area to another, students would invariably stop him to ask, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat time is it, Sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For rest of the time at camp all activities were run 15 minutes earlier than they should be, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con Peterson Time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Amazing (to think about it today) what a sense of power and attitude can do. Rein did have the ultimate official power because he determined the final grades for everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female architects decided that Rein would become sort of their protector, because there some 240 males in the three camps all together. Rein lived with another instructor in the same house as the architects. On one occasion one of the female architects was very late for roll call. Rein chewed her out. It turned out that she was on her period and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help being late. What an embarrassment! One of the girls, a favourite, sat Rein down and explained the facts of life to a shocked Rein.The rest of the girls eventually informed Rein of the timing of their expected periods. What a lesson Rein learned that day, about being too full of himself. He became the keeper of very important information that day. Blush!\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery group has a nerd, including in our camp. He lived with a group on the third floor of the Chateau Bellevue hotel. He went to take a bath, left the tap running and wondered off somewhere. The water started to pour down the stairs and Rein received a call from an agitated building owner and rushed over. The owner thought that someone had died in the tub and was afraid of opening the door and going in. Rein opened the door, and there was no one there. There was a lot of yelling from the hotel owner and threats of making the nerd pay for any damage. After cooling him down, we all helped him mop up and there was apparently no damage, except for the already deflated ego of the nerd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the summer survey camp, the 3 Survey Camp Directors turned in their grades to Professor Louis Arcand and the hunt began. It was the tradition that at the end of the Summer School, that the Directors (who were fellow students, a couple of years older) would be thrown into the river from a bridge. The students, helped by the instructors would catch the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cformer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d directors and throw them off the bridge into the creek. Rein, not a very good swimmer, escaped by climbing onto the roof of the 4 storey Domaine de Brandon building. This brought out the local gendarmes who put an end to the tomfoolery of the students, and Rein escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was active in St.John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, and was elected President of the Youth Group. The Minister Raudsepp (later Bishop), asked if Rein would be interested in entering the ministry. Rein declined because the Estonian church was still very ethnic and required every time sermons of fire and thunder against the Communists, etc. This was partly due to the fact that Raudsepp was a country parson from rural Estonia and he always played to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crefugees\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. But he was an excellent religious leader who built the St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s church from nothing for the Montreal Estonians. Raudsepp also turned out later on to be a part of the Canadian spy network that kept a watch on the Estonian refugees in Montreal. He reported suspicious information to the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabour Day weekend, Rein spent in Seven Islands exploring the entertainment centres and bars with some fellow workers, staying for 2 days.\\r\\nWe were all lonely working in the bush and needing female accompaniment. A company bus took us back to Port Cartier (previously called Shelter Bay).\\r\\n\\r\\nThat summer, Rein was quartered in a Qebec Cartier Mining Company construction camp some 40 miles North off the paved road, leading Nort-East to Seven Islands . It happened that his bunk house was located at the edge of the married quarters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 camp. There Rein met Mrs. Peterson, who was the wife of a Mr. Peterson, who turned out to be the Chief Engineer from TAMS (Tibbet, Abbot, McCarthy and Stratton, Consulting Engineers from New York City).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt turned out that Mrs. Peterson had a drinking problem. Because of strict government laws, no liquor was allowed on government owned camp property. The camp was fenced in and a guarded gate was manned by security officers. Rein asked Mrs. Peterson, who drove a large station wagon, to remove the spare tire from under the trunk floor and to hide liquor bought in Seven Islands in the cavity. Rein figured that a Chief Engineer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife would not be searched too thoroughly. This turned out to be case.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein consulted (asked permission) from some other camp residents, who were known to be bootlegging, and it was agreed to grant Rein the camp \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconcession\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for bootlegging Cognac and one quart beer bottles. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s competitors had ignored a large market. Soon most of the male \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbosses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the married quarters camp started buying buying Cognac from him and also beer. But the big market for beer was among the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmacho\\xe2\\x80\\x9d workers in the camp, who took to drinking beer from QUART size bottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Peterson drove to Seven Islands, once a week, to overcome the boredom of living in the relative isolation of the construction camp. Rein shared his profits with Mrs. Peterson and rented storage closets of several fellow residents at his bunk house. This extra money helped Rein to pay university and other expenses, back in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivilization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein worked diligently in the engineering drafting office and was made the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cActing Location Engineer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in charge of several draftsmen and field engineers. Apparently the Location Engineer had been fired for always being drunk and undependable. Rein was their only alternate choice. Everyone in the office assumed Rein was the son or relative of the Chief Engineer and Rein did nothing to deny his newfound status. He started to grow himself a moustache, trying to look a little older (this moustache has lasted for a subsequent life time).\\r\\n \\r\\nLocation work involved locating the railway tracks through the Manicouagan River Canyon. The railway clung to the steep sides of the camyon. Key design feature was to make sure that the spiral curves located did not force the wheels of the engine to point in the same direction at the same time and thereby mak it subject to a fall into the canyon. The work crews were asked to follow the location plan and blast a winding shelf through the canyon, on which railway tracks could be fastened. Rein was  clearly a rookie who had never done such design work ever before. But he was always sober on the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat summer Rein also worked as prospector/surveyor, spending weeks out in the bush of Northern Quebec with Dr. Holloway (a well-known geologist). He had very long legs and was able to walk/climb over fallen trees and other under-growth much faster than Rein. Rein had to carry a heavy theodolite and other surveying paraphanalia. Holloway would stop at an outcrop of rock and say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRein, make sure we can come back here to this exact outcrop of rock, if need be!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein spent nights taking star shots to determine the exact longitude and latitude. Some of the time Rein used a pacemeter to count the number of steps travelled to determine distance and to keep track of where we were exploring.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne saving grace was that even so far up north, government surveyors, coordinating with an airplane, had run some survey lines (blazes) marking off the different counties. These lines, thank goodness, according to French tradition, ran North-South. Rein was able to traverse there to check his measurements on longitude and latitude, periodically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest problem was taking star shots (i.e. The North Star) when all around you were tall trees. It was impossible to clear the tops of the trees with any theodolite sight. The solution was to locate a rock close to the shore of a lake and hack three holes into it for the theodolite sharp ended legs. Once standing on a rock, around 0400, Rein remembers being alone in the dark, on a relatively small rock, the tide started to raise the level of the lake. With water lapping around his ankles, Rein tried to get his Northern bearing. When you look through the scope you actually see two stars, because of the magnification. That is the North Star and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Mosquito\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. When under stress, surveyors often shoot the mosquito\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bearing by mistake. Another challenge were clouds, which ruined several astronomy shots, by covering the sky suddenly. That meant another night of setting up and trying to take the star shot again. With water lapping around his ankles Rein was always relieved to be rescued off the lonesome rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr . Holloway recounted how he had made one of his biggest iron ore discoveries. While staying at Baie Comeau, he visited a tavern where he met \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Nose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a half-breed native Indian. Who was telling a story about how he and his wife had got into an argument and he had decided to go for a walk in woods (called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe bush\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, locally). After walking several days he had kicked, in anger, a stone that turned out to be very heavy. He had hurt his big toe. Holloway asked him several questions about the stone and surroundings and decided that the stone kicked by Big Nose could have contained siqnificant amount of iron.Holloway asked whether Big Nose could find again the place where he had kicked the stone. Big Nose and Holloway walked for about a day and Big Nose pointed to a stone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere it is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, he said. It turned out to be a fortunate moment and a potential mine site.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point of the story, told to me, was that all the modern surveying technology could not match the ability of the local aboriginal bushman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to navigate in the North country, and that, put the newly minted surveyor, Rein, in his place, and rightly so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll summer long Rein and Tiiu exchanged letters commiserating about each others feelings of uncertainly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou sounded like a beautiful young woman, talking not as a disillusioned, moody depressed girl \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 what I am afraid of now is that you might think of me as a self-rightious fool, that I probably am \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been beaten twice to complete submission, once dancing with you, once having deep discussions with you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. (Recorded in a letter September 2, 1959) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1960\\r\\nBrazil\\'s Capital is Moved to Brazilia a newly built City \\r\\nFirst Televised Presidential Debates \\r\\nLunch Counter Sit-In at Woolworth\\'s in Greenboro, NC \\r\\nMost Powerful Earthquake Ever Recorded Hits Chile \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile at the McGill University, Rein couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make up his mind as to what he wished to specialize in. Therefore he registered first in Metallurgical Engineering and found the courses too abstract and specialized. He laso tried Mining Engineering for a couple of weeks and found the courses too practical and mundane. He next registered in Architecture. He had the good/bad luck to have his drafting desk located next to Moishe Safdi (who became one of the most world-famous architects that Canada has ever produced). Looking over at the drafting assignment drawings that Moishe was producing, Rein was intimidated and decided he could not match such talent. \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, as a fourth try Rein registered in Civil Engineering (Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering majors). As fate would have it Rein scored the highest grade in Civil Engineering drafting, 98%. Maybe Rein would have survived in architecture?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, after 12 final examinations, Rein thought he had graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. Rein was ecstatic, walking home along McGill College Avenue, when he ran into a classmate, who informed him that there was one more examination to take. What? It turned out that every Saturday morning there had been lectures in Mechanics of Materials for Civil Engineers (which Rein had never attended) and that the examination for this course was the next day. Rein had missed a whole course. Fortunately, his classmate had bought mimeographed class notes from someone and was able to sell them to Rein. He studied throughout the whole night, memorizing valuable information, such as, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMacAdam Roads contain compacted three eights inch gravel \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein passed the course and graduated with an overall 75.6% average. Convocation was held at the old Molson Hockey Arena, with Gen. Georges P. Vanier, a Canadian war hero, as Chancellor of McGill University. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, Romulus, was lost among the vast crowd, when Rein shook the hand of The Honourable Georges P.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon graduation, Rein bought himself his first car, a Morris Minor 1000 that had only a third gear (no first, reverse, second or fourth). It had to be parked, facing down on a hill, so that it could be started. Once in a while Rein ended up in a dead-end street and the only escape was to find 4 sturdy males, to lift up the small car, and turn it 180 degrees. Otherwise it was a fine little automobile.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon graduation from Engineering School, Rein signed an employment contract with Quebec Cartier Mining Company and headed up North to Port Cartier, Quebec (some 100 miles down the North Shore of The St. Lawrence River from Seven Islands). This was the location of the head office of QCMC. Somewhere along the way, Rein had made friends with a beautiful girl, who turned out to be the daughter of the CEO of QCMC. When Rein found out that she now lived in Port Cartier, he asked her for her address. The two-laned highway from Seven Islands to Port Cartier had just been paved. She told me to take an automobile from the Seven Islands Airport along the newly paved road to its end in Port Cartier. To Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprise, the paved road, did wind along the North Shore, right into Port Cartier and ended up in her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new driveway to a monster house. A big party was under way and Rein joined in, but decided that this young lady too was a little out of his leaque. That was the end of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were placed in a College Recruitment Training Programme. There were 10 of us \\xe2\\x80\\x9cengineer-trainees\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. For two whole days, we, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfuture management trainees,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were under noticeable strain and tension. All of us had worked previously for the company during the early development days. An assistant supervisor of training tried to spend 2.5 hours lecturing us on the history of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development days. He had joined the company recently and we corrected him on many of the mistakes he made in telling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cour\\xe2\\x80\\x9d story. Everyone took an intense dislike of the fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt lunch, the supervisor of training, unexpectedly, said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPete (Rein), I believe from reports that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had some friction at the Northern End\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. All of a sudden everyone realized that reports of spying on us were not unfounded. Rein replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not recall any \\xe2\\x80\\x98friction\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that I have been involved in during my stay at the North end. Could you clear me up on that, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Being at a definite disadvantage, Rein could not understand the situation which he was been accused of. As a group we decided that we had been tricked into an argument so that they could observe us. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou Rein are an exceptionally brilliant fellow, but go easy, realize your status as a freshly graduated engineer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Was the advice of the supervisor of training (sounding defensive). Rein believed that he had not lost his composure, as some of the others had.\\r\\nOur guest for dinner was Dr. Jean Paul Drolet, a vice-president. His message was about the history and folklore of the region, the Montangais Indians and famous Quebecers of the region. We all agreed the lecture was fascinating. Rein was asked to thank the speaker. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Drolet, on behalf of the gentlemen present, I would like to thank you for an inspiring speech \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I think all of us Canadians have gained something from your enthusiasm and pride in our province and country\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 merci bien.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein spoke enthusiastically to him after dinner and a week later received an autographed book from him, as a gift, \\xe2\\x80\\x98La Vie et le Sport sur la Cote Nord\\xe2\\x80\\x99. It was an interesting read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTiiu, I have enclosed 2 job application forms for our company \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I believe you would like this place \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I have now met close to 30 top men in the company \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 But it looks like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take some time before I become President\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. (June 7)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTiiu, I will be in Montreal for the Labour Day weekend and I will not accept a no for answer. I want a date with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (June 7)\\r\\n\\r\\nRein found leaving Montreal, for a 3 year contract, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpermanently\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, as no easy task. Pulling up roots after 22 years, was eventful, as was the leaving of his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house for the first time. Rein had a tremendous urge to own some land. He set himself a goal of buying 2.5 acres of land near Brownsburg. This came to represent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbelonging\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a somewhat feeble contact with solid ground. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI telephoned my father and he said that the land I had chosen, at Pruuli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (Estonian) farm, was very poor, swampy, too bushy, etc. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to buy it with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (June 7)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter three weeks, I still feel like a square peg in a round hole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. (July 1)\\r\\n\\r\\n Rein was eventually located in a camp on the railway line and acted as the resident camp engineer, in the middle of nowhere, at Mile 142. He was also the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Northern Region Bridges Engineer. Later on he was transferred to live in the new city being built at Gagnonville.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost bridges were no problem to engineer. But there was a huge, scary, challenging, long spiral fill to a bridge, that ended with a tunnel, to build. It called for all of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wits and withering skills to engineer. First, there were abutments to build and an experienced surveyor had been assigned to help Rein. He challenged Rein to race climb up the wooden superstructure of the first abutment being built. Both of us would be carrying our theodolites over our shoulders. This left only one hand free, to hold on to 2 x 6 inch wooden planks. We would climb up by letting loose of the wooden log we were holding, leaning back and clambering upwards to grab the next 2 x 6 inch protrusion. The abutment being built was about 5 floors high. As my competitor was climbing a little ahead of me, he grabbed hold of the next higher 2 x 6, leaned back, and found that the 2 x 6 was not nailed down. He fell down the 5 stories to the ground, onto his back. Rein also fell down, while trying to grab hold of passing fastened down 2 x 6 logs, some of which snapped. What slowed Rein down were the protruding fastened down logs that struck Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grotch. He did not fall all the way down. His grotch received a brutal set of bumps and his body was scratched. But he was safe. His surveying colleague had to be evacuated by helicopter to a hospital. Rein took the next few days off and lay in his bunk nursing his wounds and ego. The surveyor was never heard from again and Rein inherited all of his surveying and engineering work left to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first big challenge was to lay out all the batter boards indicating the dimensions of the giant spiral curve. The key to such a survey was to make sure that the centre of the spiral was the centre line of the track, which had to lean toward the outside edge of the spiral, so that the force of a train travelling on the curve would be supported. That is why the curves around bends in the highway and especially on automobile race tracks are slanted to counteract the centrifugal force. One night, when Rein was again consulting his surveying texts, he realized that he had not done that. A huge fill had been constructed at the wrong curvation, according to his instructions. At the bottom of the spiral fill was a huge culvert to allow the large creek/drainage system to pass through. All this needed to be changed or a train would tumble over the edge of the fill. Rein had made a rookie mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, while Rein was trying to have an anxiety-laden sleep, there was the biggest tropical storm, in that region, which lasted until the morning. When we arrived at the construction site we discovered a total disaster. The creek had swollen to a torrent of water that could not flow through the culvert and a large body of water had dammed up and swept the centre of the fill away. All of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batter boards were missing and some of the wooden abutments had been destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord had obviously come to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aid. The size of the culvert built at the bottom of the fill had been at least two times too small and this design error was not Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault. Rein started to reline/resurvey the batter boards, this time setting the center line of track outside the centre line of fill. This now indicated that the huge fill had to be rebuilt because it was in the wrong place. The contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general foreman went ballistic. To which Rein replied that the contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surveyor had checked the line and confirmed it. He could do this again. This implied that a huge mass of fill had been moved by the flood. There was a blissful silence and the general foreman wowed never to trust Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s batter boards again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext was the tunnel to be built on a relatively sharp curve. It was almost impossible to survey the curve by flipping a theodolite scope 180 degrees to mark the next center line marker accurately. No scope in those days was perfectly hung. So Rein resurveyed every marker a hundred times, as the tunnel proceeded by dynamite blasting through the mountain. The contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general foreman and all people involved in building the tunnel started to haze Rein. They told him that the tunnel on the breakout end would not be coincident with the fill on the other side. Rein was nearly psyched out and his self-confidence became torn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the final blast, we all stood at the other end of the tunnel, waiting to see how well aligned the tunnel would be. Everyone was picking on Rein and pointing to points that were off the adjoining fill by up to 25 feet. Rein was in a panic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final blast blew away the location of the final portal and to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relief, \\r\\nhis center line of track was only one inch off. There was celebration by all present. Rein, once again thanked the Lord. He was off the hook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next event involved a Mr. Link of the New York TAMS consulting company, he wanted to stay at our camp on the rail line. We were all a little scared because he was supposedly a very important engineer in the world and he was perhaps coming to check up on our work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Link arrived, looking disheveled, with some of his belongings in flimsy cardboard containers. Rein, as manager of the camp, spent a lot of time trying to explain to him what we were trying to do. One day we were sitting around the kitchen table, he had brought with him a bottle of white liquid, from which he bored himself glassfuls to drink. Rein initially thought that it was purefied water which we also tried to drink. When he offered Rein a drink, it became clear that the liquid was Gin.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe next day Link insisted that he wanted to go out on the railway costruction line, alone, to do an inspection tour. While Rein was out surveying, some of the men at our camp found him dead on the right of way and we had to make arrangements to ship his corpse to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivilization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein gathered his pitiful personal effects and put them into a duffel bag. Apparently, with today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective, Mr. Link was a very serious alcoholic and he was sent probably to Northern Quebec, as a way of finding him something to do, away, from the New York office. This was a very sad story.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was next asked to go and work in the developing company town/city of Gagnon. He was given a nice one-room bachelor apartment and the use of a Jeep. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Morris Minor 1000 had not yet been shipped to Gagnon. That was eventually the first private car to reach Gagnon.\\r\\n\\r\\n Rein was to work on the laying out of the streets for the suburb that would house the married folks in typical two and one storey suburban haouses and that also served the single women who worked for the company. He also was to straighten the road from the airport to the Lake Barbel Lodge, through town and thence to the Lac Jeannine mine site. Rein straightened out a jog that went to the shore of Lake Shirley and it subsequently became the local lovers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the exciting days in exploration, this work assignment seemed tedious and with the encouragement of the bosses, Rein was encouraged to work on the local amenities of Gagnon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was itching to have more power at his job and to promote himself among Gagnon residents. Ego, Ego, Ego was a very demanding master. After scouting around, he discovered that there was a need for a bridge club, a formal Duplicate Bridge Club, with membership in the American Bridge Clubs Association. This would include the right to award master points toward various levels of Grand Master status, recognized world wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein organized a Gagnon Duplicate Bridge Club, which met every Saturday night at the Mess Hall. Precisely at 1900 all the doors would be locked and the tournament would start. It became very popular and Rein acted as the Director, during Games night, resolving disagreements and mistakes made during the games. For this purpose he used a manual that he had acquired from The Canadian Contact Bridge Association. Before the Game Night he prepackaged hands to create interesting situations at the 30 some tables. Rein played with Denise Michaud, a beautiful woman who served as the Corporate Telex Operator.  She was a very good player and saved Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s many quick play mistakes that he made as the Director while wondering around the hall. Rein even was put into the position of having to ban the entry of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDutch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schultz to the Hall because he had arrived 30 minutes late and the doors had already been locked. Schultz was the most senior company general manager at Gagnon and the Mine Site. He eventually approved of what Rein had ruled.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein became good friends with bridge players like, Dutch Huff the General Manager of the North End, the Secretary of the Centre Recreatif de Ville Gagnon, the Treasurer, the Mayor, the Chief Accountant, North End, the Director of Industrial Relations and others. All of them were members of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in-group.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenise loved to learn to drive my Morris car. She eventually graduated to trying to drive my Jeep, but she proved too tiny to reach the clutch and break petals. Macho Rein would bail her out anytime she got into difficulties. Denise was a proper Catholic girl from Trois Pistoles. Our relationship was platonic. Rein nick-named her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDemi-Chaud\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. She had a beautiful, blonde, blue-eyed sister with the biggest nose that Rein ever has seen on a human face. The protruding nose apparently prevented males from pursuing her. She and Rein became friends and she shared her excellent collection of popular music records, \\r\\n\\r\\nRein had a girlfriend also at the construction camp residential village at Lac Jeannine. Her name was Jeanne. Early in the morning when Rein went to go home to Gagnon, he had to drive through the small village in his Morris, with the missing gears, that made the car go \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctick-tick-tick \\xe2\\x80\\xa6..\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Everybody in the village knew his paramour adventures. He had to cross part of the Lake along an exposed causeway. Rein sometimes resorted to using his Jeep for his visits to Jeanne. One early morning, after sleeping in, Rein drove across the causeway backwards, in plain daylight, trying to make the people, at work in the Lac Jeannine office, think he was driving towards the construction camp, not vice versa. This became the worst kept secret at the company and many jokes were played on Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the urging of Denise, Rein agreed to put on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpera Nights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for all the married ladies, the single ladies, and some others at the suburb section of Gagnon in various private homes. Rein dressed in his courdoroi pants, wore an Ascot and beret. (Just like he did during his beatnik days in the Montreal coffee houses). He recited poetry, with \\xe2\\x80\\x9csavoir faire\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which he subsequently commented on. His presentation of the opera \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa Boheme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in French, played on a gramaphone was everybod\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite. The music to this day brings out all the romantic feelings in Rein that he can muster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young single ladies, lead by Denise, hatched a plan for getting together with \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d young men in the Gangon area. The plan was to have Rein invite young men to a single girls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 party at one of the suburban houses. Rein had to control and vouch for the conduct of the men he recommended. The girls prepared the food and the environment and Rein approached C-40 airplane pilots who were often stranded in Gagnon for the night on the airport tarmack. Rein asked the pilots to ferry the best liquors and chocolate from Montreal and he would introduce them at a wonderful party. These parties were a great success and Rein became very popular in Gagnon, called by many young men, jealously, inappropriately, as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Whoremaster\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Fortunately, everything went well, and probably some long-term relationships were made.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein took the opportunity to get back into the bootlegging business and asked the C-40 pilots to ferry Quart beer bottles and Remy Martin Cognac to Rein in return for his services as a go-between with ladies of Gagnon. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9choods\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed to allow Rein the same concession for bootlegging as he had in the Port Credit camp before. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDutch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Huff, the boss, was one his best customers.\\r\\nAs the town/city grew juvenile delinquency became a problem. There were several police groups in the area, the City of Gagnon police, the contractors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Security/Police and the RCMP. We discussed what to do about the problem. Obviously the teenagers were bored and getting into trouble. It was agreed that Rein would try to start a Youth Club. The Protestant Minister agreed to cooperate (Rein sang in the church choir). The majority of the children, by far, were Catholic, therefore the Catholic Bishop in Riviere de Loup forbade the congregation of children from the two religions in a Youth Club. That pretty well stopped that idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had also approached the Quebec Liquor Board to grant the city a Beer Store Concession, profits from which would have gone to fund the Youth Club. With the Club idea, stillborn, all kinds of officials became involved and the Beer Store idea was implemented. This became a great event in Gagnon and the area. Rein remembers looking at the main road, through the city, from his window. Big macho men were carrying 2 to 3 cases of beer on their shoulders. An RCMP officer, in his full red regalia, came marching down the hill and all the macho men scrambled into the bushes where they hid in habitual fear. But buying beer at the store was now legal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the same RCMP officer entered the Mess Hall several of the people eating stood up in respect. Such respect was very unusual. For example, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Jean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, more than 6 foot 6 inches tall, working for the camp Security/Police, was regularly beaten up by macho drunken men, who sought him out, and picked a fight to prove their manhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last project Rein became involved in was the building of the Lac Barbel Ski Hill. Rein helped survey the site. But in late November he decided that he wanted to leave the rather \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunreal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d environment in Gagnon and return to Montreal. He hitched a ride with one of his C-40 pilot friends. He telephoned Mr. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDutch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Huff from Montreal and resigned, who said he understood. The exciting days of prospecting, and the like, were over and Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see himself raising a family, etc. in isolation, at such a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbush\\xe2\\x80\\x9d city of Gagnon or with Quebec Cartier Mining Company. He \\xe2\\x80\\x9cescaped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Montreal, without local announcement, because he was afraid that someone at the company would make an offer that he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t refuse. He had paid off most of his debts, but he arrived in Montreal stone broke.\\t\\r\\n\\r\\nRein rented a room on Drummond Street, just above Sherbrooke Street. Getting a job in late November proved to be very difficult. Other renters in the rooming house were students from The National Theatre School. Rein shared a shelf in our common refrigerator with, soon to be famous, Stratford Shakespearean actor, Martha Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\nTiiu, bless her soul, came toRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aid and lent Rein some money to help Rein until he could get a job. Her father was somehow involved. Her father  probably wondered who this wayward penniless fellow was. She consoled me with several meetings at Coffee Houses on nearby Crescent Street. Rein, the neophyte, unsophisticated boy, had been saved once again by the more sophisticated opposite sex. Women always seemed to feel sorry for him. Perhaps this was something he had learned during the War years begging in Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n1961\\r\\nAdolf Eichmann on Trial for Role in Holocaust \\r\\nBay of Pigs Invasion \\r\\nBerlin Wall Built \\r\\nFreedom Riders Challenge Segregation on Interstate Buses \\r\\nJFK Gives \"Man on the Moon\" Speech \\r\\nSoviets Launch First Man in Space \\r\\nStalin\\'s Body Removed From Lenin\\'s Mausoleum\\r\\n\\r\\nLuck smiled on Rein and he was offered a job by the Outside Plant Department of The Bell Telephone Company of Canada. He became the Eastern Region Foundations and Location Engineer. It turned out to be a wonderful job, as Rein got to practice his engineering specialty \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoil Mechanics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and his penchant for project management. Ma Bell was in the process of locating new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRepeater Huts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d across the Eastern Region (from New Brunswick to Brighton, Ontario. It became Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job to work with the company real estate people in choosing appropriate sites, where dependable foundations could be built, The extant telephone technology apparently was electro-mechanical and very sensitive to vibrations or slight deviations in the building foundations over time. On any site Rein had to locate the best location for the building and then design and prepare the Foundation drawings.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein located and designed 111 building foundations in the Eastern Region by September, 1961. To meet budget and flexibility constraints, Rein invented with the help of Prof. Selby (McGill) a portable soil testing drill system using devices ranging from Shelby Tubes, to impact hammers that operated via manually operated pullies. The whole device and supporting equipment barely fitted in the back of a rented large stationwagon automobile trunk. Admittedly, because of Rein, the back springs were strained to the maximum. Rein hired two McGill engineering students to do the actual drilling and testing after they had been trained by Rein, by completing jointly three or four sites. Rein spent the rest of the time preparing 4 standard foundation designs to cover most situations in the field. He also coordinated the activities of the real estate agents and the testing crew in the field. Rein would go to the field site if anything unusal turned up, to make decisions about the suitability of a site.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything proceeded according to plan, except for a phone call from the Lac St. Jean region. A French Canadian contractor called Rein and asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctis rock, I dug 16 feet and not-ting, sides of the hole falling in!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What had happened was that the wrong drawings for the foundation had been sent, which specified, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDig foundation until rock.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There was obviously no rock (The local contractor knew the local topography better than us, but, wanted to get paid hourly for digging more). Rein had to relocate the building location on the site. The contractor was paid for refilling the huge empty hole. He was then obviously \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun Joyeux Gens \\xc3\\x8atre n\\xc3\\xa9 pour un petit pain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari dated frequently, probably because Tiiu lved outside of Montreal at inaccessable Lakeside, a small suburb, not easy to reach by public transport. We started to meet at Philip\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Park, where there was, during the summer, a band playing on the park bandshell. Mari brought the sandwiches and Rein provided the wine. We both worked at buildings, close by. Eventually, Rein accepted invitations to come for breakfast and then they would walk together to work in the morning. Then, Rein was invited for dinner, often, and he would fall asleep on the sofa in the sitting room, after dinner. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother became convinced that this fellow, Rein, was a \\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno-goodnick\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixty miles outside Montreal East, lies Sainte Madeleine, well known for its clay subsurface. St. Madeleine Clay is very solid if it is confined on four sides. If you pick up a handful of the clay it runs out of your hand like thick Quebec soupe des pois, and is a well known challenge for foundation engineers. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be safe Rein approached the local cure/priest and excused himself for wanting to see the basement, and foundations of the church. By far the biggest building in town, Rein figured he would design a similar foundation for his building. After they had tea, which the kind priest supplied, he asked Rein as to what did he find. Rein told him, that he too was a religious man, but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that the church was standing up straight, because of God. Humans had built the church. It turned out upon his inspection, that, the whole church stood on a foundation that had been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Ste. Madeleine Clay. The cure looked at Rein kindly and smiled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x99Accord!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They shook hands. The foundation he designed turned out to be one of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small engineering victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not the case in Brighton, Ontario, the building developed a long narrow crack in its foundation. Rein always thought about that when driving between Toronto and Montreal or Ottawa along the 401. He inspected the site several times. All seemed to be well. One such misdemeanor among 111 sites that he designed, was not too bad, he rationalized.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in 1961, as Eastern Region Soils Engineer, Rein was asked to go to Kingston and to check out a situation where the construction workers were afraid that they had become mired in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquick sand\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein had failed the Bell Telephone driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license examination because of his eyesight (stigmatism). He had had difficulty in perceiving depth in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstupid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d experimental box with many colours, etc. As a result he was assigned a driver, by the name of William Killen, the Head Draftsman, who worked for Rein, and he had to drive Rein to any special site investigations.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein knew that there was no such thing as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquick sand\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that miraculously, dangerously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csucked\\xe2\\x80\\x99 people and vehicles underground. Of course, the contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employees and others did not believe this. When Rein arrived, he encountered a D-8 Caterpillar tractor with its front end under mud in a foundation hole and everyone excited and not making any sense in their suggestions as to what should be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the back of every D-8 Caterpillar tractor there is always a winch, and Rein ordered that the coiled metal rope from the winch be attached to a tree, so that the winch could pull the tractor out from the hole. Then he jumped into the hole with his rubber boots (to everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprise) and conducted several phony \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflow tests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and concluded that the contractors had struck an underground stream that flowed along a permeable seam of slate and silt. This was obviously not a good location to build a building foundation. After conducting several more \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered that the foundation of the building under construction be moved to the other end of the building lot and everyone was happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that point Rein had become aware that he was stranded in Kingston, because Killen had to leave for Montreal, with the car. It was after all Friday. When Rein went to the railway station he discovered that the train for Montreal had left and he would be stranded for many hours. Angry, Rein asked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere is the next train going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The answer was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToronto!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So he bought a ticket and took the train to Toronto and from there on to London, Ontario. Rein had read an article in the Weekend Magazine of The Montreal Star that there was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBiz-wives Club\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Business School of the University of Western Ontario. The article included a partial description of what an MBA programme was all about. It sounded very interesting and something that Rein felt he needed to learn. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein had learned that most \\xe2\\x80\\x9cengineering\\xe2\\x80\\x9d problems ended up being 20% engineering knowledge and 80% an ability of being able to deal with management and conflictive relationships between people. He felt that his engineering education had not provided him with the necessary skills for dealing with management issues in project management. So he decided to go and check out what the relatively new University of Western Ontario MBA Programme was all about. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat weekend he stayed at the London YMCA and then on Monday met with Professors from the Business School and sampled some of the classes by sitting in as a visitor. Rein registered and started the first year MBA programme the day after Labour Day.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt was another major happenstance of a change in his life (that is, Rein had been reading accidentally Peter Drucker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Management book and then the Weekend Magazine insert). Voila! He had previously decided that, while the past several months of work had been interesting, there was no future for him at Bell Telephone Company in the long-run. Progress up the responsibility ladder was far too slow.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon joining Bell, Rein had been instructed to spend the first 3 months reading a large looseleaf book containing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRules and Standard Practices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Bell Company. No one asked him any questions or offered any explanations. Rein also whiled away his time reading a book he had found in his desk door, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Principles of Management\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Peter Drucker. While, very dry, it seemed to address al the right questions in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s na\\xc3\\xafve opinion. It was a momentous chance event, the beginning of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MBA/PhD career. Therefore, a MBA at Western Ontario University made sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari was disconsolant on hearing that Rein would leave Montreal for London in September. Standing in the middle of Durocher and Milton Streets (for some reason), Rein tried to explain, that he was a poor boy, and had a lot of things to achieve to reach personal financial viability. He asked Mari to wait for him, and that this was not a time to make any promises about the future. Tears were shed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ma Bell hierarchy was made up of 9 levels and had many bureaucratic rules. Promotion from level 1 to level 2 could take up to 10 years. Mr. Duncan was level 2 and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boss. He reported to a level 3, Mr. Valentine, an architect. We all worked on the same floor, in a matrix-patterned mass of undifferentiated desks. It was true that Valentine had a small \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around his desk. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk was located directly in front of Valentine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to the fenced off area. Apparently that was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh status\\xe2\\x80\\x9d location. Every day Rein found his desk moved slightly away from that location and a neighbour had squeezed into his space. Valentine reported to a level 4 who had the corner office. Everyone seemed to be bored to death. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soil mechanics and foundations design assignment was clearly an exception to standard work practice. For example, Valentine, took the money Rein had saved in his budget and bought himself a large sample of different paint colours, apparently to test his own architectural fancies and theories about colour coordination, on our building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein called the responsible office about the Company Procedures, he was told, that the man, who had determined the current cost of capital logic, had been transferred several years ago. Therefore, for some 3 years, all corporate capital investment decisions had/were apparently being made with an outdated (seemingly bogus) cost of capital yardstick. When Rein reached Cornell University, to study for his PhD, he spent several courses learning about the intricacies of capital budgeting. It was not a simple clerical matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, it is surprising, that Rein could get enough money together to pay the first year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fees and expenses. Tuition fees were much less than today, maybe less than $1,500 per year. In some letters to Tiiu, Rein mentioned that he had, at that time, 80% of the funds reguired for first year expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt registration, Rein met James Vasoff and Hugh Moncreiff, and they agreed to share an apartment at 8 Oak Park, off Wharncliffe Road. They became very good friends. It was a two bedroom apartment and Rein agreed to sleep in the living room, to save money. They shared a kitchen and did their own cooking, most of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames was Macedonian, from Toronto. He fancied himself as a professional comic and used Rein as his straight man on some gigs. We jointly performed at several Faculty shows. Rein discovered that Jim had to do intensive preparation before a show, so as to come across as an apparently spontaneous ad libbing comic. It was not accidental, as he made it appear. We found that he actually was a pretty serious fellow and did not participate in good natured joking. For him it was all a professional art. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe drove a large Mercedes Benz and lost his liscense for various traffic violations. Rein ended up driving his car to get to University. Jim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother made the best cookies imaginable and sent them regularly to London. We tried to share the cookies as much as possible and Jim ended up hiding them, behind the window curtains, visible to anyone walking by on the outside. We finally got his mother to give us the recipe, but, Mari, could not replicate their flavor. Apparently, mom had left out one ingredient to protect her magical speciality.\\r\\n\\r\\nHugh came from Winnipeg and was the son of a wealthy man who owned a well known engine manufacturing company. Hugh was the neat one of us three and had all kinds of routines, systems and plans. For example, to make sure that he could get maximum of sleep, by getting up at the very last moment, he had a routine planned. Rein and Jim decided to play a joke on him. One night when Hugh came home, quite inhebriated, Rein and Jim had rearranged his room. We moved his bed. According to his plans, it had been located directly across from his door, allowing him to storm out of his room to the bathroom and thence to School. We set his clock to ring early, and when it went off he stormed up and hit the wall (somebody had moved the door?).  He hit the other wall, one more time, this time alarming Jim, who slept on the other side of the wall, and Jim fell out of his bed. Rein continued sleeping peacefully in the living room.\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately, once per week Mari sent Rein a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFood Package\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Greyhound Bus. She baked Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite dessert called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKringel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and other goodies to supplement Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own limited cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\n1962\\r\\nCuban Missile Crisis \\r\\nFirst Person Killed Trying to Cross the Berlin Wall \\r\\nJames Meredith Admitted Into the Segregated University of Mississippi \\r\\nMarilyn Monroe Found Dead\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Taylor was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s professor for the Control (accounting) course. He had spinopifida and sat slouched on his back and glared at us from the top of his big black horn-rimmed glasses. He had a sharp wit and was a good teacher. Rein got into an argument with him, after pointing out to him that he, Rein, was a Professional Engineer. Rein was mochingly cross-examined by Taylor to the hilarity of the class. He asked Rein an obscure accounting question, at end of our exchange, and responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t throw away your sliderule, as yet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At the end of the course he only gave Rein a grade of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the lowest grade Rein ever received at Western and it prevented Rein from getting the highest average graduating grade for the MBA.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was one of the hardest working students in the class, and always was well prepared for case discussions. At Oak Park, where we lived, there were 4 buildings in a circle facing each other. Each of us knew each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s window location. At night when we were studying, we would glance at each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s windows, to see who was the last person to continue preparations for next day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case discussions. To try and psych out fellow students, we would leave on our lights even when we were already sleeping. Other aggressive competitive actions were also used in our efforts to beat each other in class debates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best students eventually became recognized and a group of students formed a discussion group around Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership. During the first year we all participated in a Business Game (that had been computerized). Our group was very successful and learned how to access other unrelated games to boost their net profits to enormous levels, thereby beating the computer logic designed by its creators, and won the game by a wide margin. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skill at analysis was among the best in the class and the professors recognized this, when they needed to have someone analyze the case company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial statements, they asked Rein to express his opinion (despite Prof. Taylor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low opinon of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accounting abilities).\\r\\n\\r\\nBobbie Waugh was a Professor of Production Management. Rein served as his teaching assistant. He was a sick man and close to retirement age. He had a physical condition that resulted in him falling asleep gradually, usually sitting on the edge of the instructor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk. When he would doze off, Rein would rise from his seat and lead the case discussion on his behalf. He died at the end of the term and Rein was invited to the funeral by Mrs. Waugh. Rein arrived at the funeral parlor and announced to a person on the door that he was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9can honourary Ball bearer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This became a running joke, most enjoyed by Mrs. Waugh and other attendees. English was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth language and he had trouble with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cp\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cb\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cg\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ck\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and perhaps some other intricacies of the English language.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein dated Nancy Stinson who was a student in the Nursing Faculty. Nancy had the penchant of painting her face fiercely, and she looked like a candidate prostitute, to most batchelors in the class. Nancy was actually a perfect lady and good company. Nancy did not scare Rein and they became friends and went to MBA class events together. Even the London police had their doubts and stopped us once. Rein was made to walk a straight line and display his credentials.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, Rein invited Mari to come to the big celebration dance at the end of first year. Mari arrived with a blazing red, clinging to her sexy body dress, with a V-Neck, that was cut down almost to her navel and she wore no brazziere. She was by far the hottest woman at the dance. Everyone wanted to dance with her and even Dean Wettlaufer asked her to dance 3 times. Mari definitely caught Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention and he spent the evening protecting Mari from \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuitors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who wanted a dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari stayed with Walter Schima and his wife Joanna, who lived in an adjacent apartment. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dress and makeup, at the year-end gala, clearly had Joanna\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guiding hand in it, as Rein was to find out later.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Summer Rein needed to get a job to pay his bills for year 2. He was hired by an engineering consulting firm, Veitch, Skelton & Associates, in London. Rein became the Resident Engineer, responsible for a large construction project in the Town of Aylmer, doing an extensive upgrade of their Sewerage System, during summer, 1962 and part of the Fall between the I and II MBA school years.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein laid out and built a system that included a trunk sewer, along main street, which was also the Provincial Highway number 3, it was approximately 2 miles long. The system included a pump station and purification ponds out in a farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fields. Rein had to quickly learn about legal contracts, poorly specified engineering design drawings, the granting of money for unforeseen \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExtras\\xe2\\x80\\x9d supposedly not included in the legal contract, negotiated with Ontario Water Resources Commision, Ontario Department of Labour, and the Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Compensation Commision. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein also attended meetings of town Council, appeared on London CBC television with progress reports and also was interviewed in print media. His primary job was supposed to be providing leadership to the reticent contractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crew. They tended to slow the project down, constantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein eventually understood that all the Ontario (small) construction companies purposely bid their contracts too low, nearly below construction costs, to win as many contracts as possible. The way they planned to make money was to bully the Resident Engineer in charge regarding being paid for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExtra\\xe2\\x80\\x9d work they had to do that was not been specified in the construction contract they had signed. The construction contract was an incomplete document prepared by government engineers/bureaucrats in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leader (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe BOSS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) of the Construction Company was a General Foreman, called Big Joe. He was Italian, more than 6 feet 6 inches tall and massive. His job was to get Rein to sign, as many as possible, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExtra\\xe2\\x80\\x9d payments. It was a constant battle with him as Rein tried to interpret Contracts and incomplete design drawings by trying to match his bullying tactics.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had an assistant, an engineering student, and they shared a cottage at Port Bruce, a fishing village on Lake Erie. He had a Labador black dog called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrince\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. During the summer Mari came to Port Bruce and rented a separate cottage. Prince took an immediate liking to Mari, who no doubt spoiled him. Prince loved to run at full throttle into Lake Erie, until one day, when it was stormy, he ran into a big wave and was flipped onto the beach on his back, somewhat winded. Mari nursed his ego back. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe used a screw type device to tie Prince up in the back yard. Every morning, after we left for work, Prince learned how to pull up the screw from the ground, with his powerful jaws, and carried it to spend the day at Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cottage. Prince also had an ongoing chase game going on with a neighbour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cat, who teased him. While we were sitting on the back porch, the cat usually tried to sneak past Prince\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nose, quietly, and a chase usually ended at a wire fence, with the cat fitting through the rectangle pattern and Prince running full speed, into the webbing, with a painful yelp. Mari, once again nursed his ego. Rein had bought a beautiful 1953 Chrysler Hard Top Convertible, with a white top and a sky blue body (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca monster car\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a very powerful engine). It was a real girl catcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein became a good friend with Dr. Harrison, a veteranian and the mayor of Aylmer. He was a big help with local politics. For entertainment, Rein accompanied the good doctor to local farms and learned how to help with the birthing of calves and vaccinating horses and other animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe locals were supposed to help us in the hooking up of their house connections. This would cost them extra money and subsequently tax payments. Many people would deny, that, while digging the deep trunk sewer, that a house connecting pipe we cut was \\xe2\\x80\\x9capparently\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theirs. We were forced to hook up such \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecret\\xe2\\x80\\x9d house connections, because the trunk sewer work had to progress forward by backfilling the trench. Rein invented what came to be called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeterson Plug\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Anyone denying that a pipe was not theirs, had under Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s orders, their pipe plugged up. We waited for the owner to eventually come screaming, because his sewer had backed up. The solution was always obvious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contractor tried to pull a fast one and did not, for a whole block, install house connections to the property line. Rein hired a backhoe and demonstrated to Big Joe his negligent action and then charged the costs to him, and, furthermore, made him go back and dig all the missing house connections properly. A lot of aggressive anger was expressed by all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt most urban construction projects, there were what we called \\xe2\\x80\\x9csidewalk superindents\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. These were usually retired, older men, who were bored and passed the days watching us work. Rein made friends with these men, and gave them unofficial status by explaining to them what to look for, to make the contractor do his work properly. They were to report anything that they saw that seemed to be not properly constructed. These men stood every 300 or so feet along the trench. Big Joe was boiling mad, about the presence of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nA restaurant-owner claimed that his house connection had not been hooked up properly. So we poured a big jug full of cherry extract down his toilet and had the owner standing in a nearby man hole, as he watched the red liquid pass by. \\r\\n\\r\\nA more extensive charge was leveled by the owner of the Aylmer Hotel, who claimed that his house connection was not big enough. Rein asked that every employee and some others stand next to a toilet and flush when he blew the whistle. All was well and the story made the front page of the Aylmer Express newspaper. Rein also had to crawl trough the trunk sewer pipe between two man holes to make sure that Old Joe and his boys had done a good enough job sealing the pipe joints. Rein was and is clostrophopic. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein also had developed a reputation for divining the location of water pipes. One of the machines digging the main trench struck a water main and it burst, throwing water more than 4 storeys straight up. The town foreman came running and informed Rein that the turn-off valve had been paved over and he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure of its exact location. Rein tried his divining skills by using two wire clothes hangers and located the approximate location of the valve and we were able to shut the water off. Another front page story for the Aylmer Express was written.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein ate his meals at a downtown restaurant, where a young girl, named Monique, was the head chef. She could see through the serving opening everyone in the restaurant, including Rein. She would make Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s serving plate special every time, delicious meat and the like. Rein eventually sent her a written message, asking her for a date and we became good friends. She liked riding in the big Chrysler and we would often drive about the countryside and out to the family farm. Her parents were Belgian.\\r\\nWhere have all the young girls gone\\r\\nLong time passing\\r\\nWhere have all the young girls gone\\r\\nLong time ago\\r\\nWhere have all the young girls gone\\r\\nGone to young men, every one\\r\\nWhen will they ever learn?\\r\\nWhen will they ever learn?\\r\\nWhere have all the young men gone\\r\\nLong time passing\\r\\nWhere have all the young men gone\\r\\nLong time ago\\r\\nWhere have all the young men gone\\r\\nGone to soldiers, every one\\r\\nWhen will they ever learn?\\r\\nWhen will they ever learn?\\r\\n--- Pete Seeger (1961) and Kingston Trio (1962)\\r\\nThe farm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well had gone dry. Monique asked Rein to divine a new well for the farm. Try as he might, he was unable to get a proper reading. Eventually he picked a spot, based on his weak divining. Her father started to dig the well and every time Rein visited he was deeper and deeper in a hole. Eventually a porous seam was found and a well was built, to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Monique\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great relief. Rein was rewarded by many good dinners at the farm. Rein had learned to believe that there is always a seam of water at any location. The only question apparently was how deep to dig for it. This assignment somewhat reduced Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal opinion that he really could really divine for water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the town the biggest challenge of the construction project was the building of an inverted syphon under Catfish Creek, which ran through the town. According to design drawings, the trunk sewer on the town site was designed to run to the edge of Catfish Creek and then down the embankment, to underneath the Creek, and then come back up on the opposite shore. Rein learned that this was called an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupside down syphon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Inverted syphons (sometimes called sag culverts or sag lines) apparently were used to convey water by gravity under roads, railroads, other structures, and various types of drainage channels. Rein had never heard about that. So Rein hit his available books to learn what he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction was to be based on the Bernoulli Principle, discovered several centuries ago. Under the Bernoulli Principle the flow rate is dependent on the height difference between the inflow and outflow of a syphon and not on atmospheric pressure. Such a structure can operate without excess head when flowing at design capacity. After passing under Catfish Creek the trunk pipe continued some 500 feet to a pump station, which pumped the sewage along pressurized pipes into lagoons in a farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s field, where it was aerated under the rays of the sun and thereby purified, over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went well and we were able to build the inverted syphon as specified. The main trunk sewer pipe was designed to flow at about one third full. Over time , actually about 6 years of delay, the OWRC and other government agencies had cut inches off the diameter of the main trunk sewer several times to reduce rising construction costs due to inflation (stupid decisions). This made the trunk sewer actually flow, regularly, more than one third full. The town was continually being paved, and in other ways the rate of water runoff was considerably higher than allowed for in the design drawrings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day that summer there was a storm that rained more inches of water than had been seen in Aylmer during the past 100 years. The trunk sewer pipe filled up to significantly more than two-thirds full, more than two times its supposed design capacity. Downtown Aylmer streets became flooded, as did the floors of stores, when the trunk sewer backed up. Clearly the pipe was underdesigned because of the bureaucrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reductions of its diameter and engineering miscalculations. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein had all overflows to Catfish Creek reopened. He ran to the inverted syphon, too late, it had been uprooted from under Catfish Creek by the streaming jet of water. A stream of water from the trunk sewer was bursting out of the remains of the siphon under Catfish Creek. The stream of water, several hundered feet long, was hitting the wall of a house, were an old couple lived. To make things worse the stream of water uprooted the gabbages from the house\\xe2\\x80\\x99s garden. As a result the old couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house wall was also being bombarded, as if from a cannon with cabbage heads. After rescuing the old couple from their house, Rein ran to the pump house which turned out to be submerged under 10 feet of water and disfunctional. It was a total disaster. Obviously, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s summer job was at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nLawyers, insurance inspectors, town politicians, OWRC officials and   Veitch and Skelton Consultants started to blame each other as to who was responsible for the disaster. Rein could demonstrate that he had built everything according to design drawings. A major design flaw was determined to be the drainage factors used that were based on data collected some 15 years earlier. In the meantime, the town had grown and the percentage of paved surface was some 4 times greater. Rather than being absorbed into bare ground, much more drainage/surface water had therefore flowed into the trunk sewer than expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein retreated to his cottage at Port Bruce for a couple of weeks, to escape the intense anger of the townfolk. Dr. Harrison, the mayor had to sell his veterinary practice and house and move to a town in Eastern Ontario. After a while Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract was terminated and Rein bid good-bye to a teary-eyed Monique and returned to University in London, Ontario to finish his studies for the MBA.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second term of the MBA programme, Rein rented with 4 other students a large house at 54 Irwin Avenue. The house was owned by a Mr. Huddlestone, who continued to live downstairs with his wife. Rodrique LaCroix, George Schroeder, Rick Chase, Derald Harris and Rein shared the five bedrooms, kitchen, dining room and toilet upstairs. The house had been a Half-way House during the stage coach days, where passangers could spend the night and continue their journey next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chrysler car was performing dependably and would start even on the coldest of days. The whole car could be all iced over in the morning and one had to chip loose the ice around the door and key hole. It seems that the very big engine was not as affected by the cold, as the smaller engines of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room mates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highlight of the second term was the Policy Course taught by Prof. Don Thain, who stretched our minds by forcing us to think originally and strategically about the future. Towards the end of the course we were reguired to form groups and write a Strategy Study for some operating company. A group was formed around Rein and we chose the company called Unit-Step Ltd., located in Woodstock Ontario. The owner-manager of the small company had received his MBA from some other school and had become fanatical about training his employees through a psychological, group building technicque, popular in 1962, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9csensitivity training\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. All his workers were Italian immigrants, who worked, very physically, building front door portable steps, out of concrete. They were not exactly the intellectual elite. They revolted, in different ways, trying to stop the owner-manager from gathering them into small groups, where everyone was directed to tell the others what they really thought of them and reveal some secrets about themselves. This process was equated with brainwashing, which they had seen during the Second World War. As a result productivity dropped dangerously low. Our Policy Study Group recommended that he cease doing sensitivity training. There was no need for it and he was not qualified to attempt it himself. Productivity improved and a recovery was made, over time, from bruised egos after sensitivity training. The owner-manager was refocused to lead marketing efforts and leave production responsibilities to a capable lead hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari was invited to the MBA Final Dance. She arrived with a very beautiful dress, that looked like a white fluffy ball gown worn in the early 1900s at European Balls. With her hair put up high on her head, she topped it off with a tiara. Rein wore his tuxedo and his fraternity colours, stretched across his chest. They made quite a splash and some strangers who attended the dance asked us whether we were royalty from Europe. Rein responded, vaguely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is quite possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRein periodically continued to date Nancy Stinson. We as a group, living at 52 Irwin, decided to invite Rosie Dutt to our house for dinner. Rosie was the only female in our MBA class. She was a foreign student from Northern India. She sat alone, a bit forlorn in a corner of classes and we felt pity for her.We agreed to cook a chicken feast and Rosie said that she would bring the condiments that she said were a specialty of her family and regional group. She showed us how to use the curry powder. When we came to eat the chicken, our Canadian mouths could not stand the fire created by Rosie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s curry. Like gentlemen, not to insult her, we all pretended that it was delicious. But, quietly, we all, one by one, sneaked out of the dining room and into the bathroom, trying unsuccessfully to put out the fire in our mouths and stomach. Rosie left us pleased and unaware and we felt we had done our gentlemanly duty, by being appropriately polite. She told us at graduation that the evening had been the highlight of her stay in London, Ontario.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Huddleston\\xe2\\x80\\x99s living room was located directly directly below Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allocated bedroom. Huddleston was partly deaf and would turn the sound on his TV disturbingly high and it was disruptive for Rein to study. One of our group, an electrical engineer, concocted a rheostat, with a dial, that created visual disturbance on Huddleston\\xe2\\x80\\x99s TV picture, downstairs. So that Rein could study, he controlled the level of sound by rotating the dial appropriately. Huddleston, after consulting several technicians, learned to keep the sound lower. The TV technician said that he was stumped for the first time as to what was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt & Joanna Schmida eventually asked Rein why he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t asked Mari to marry him. It had not ever occurred to Rein. His mind had never been on marriage or contemplating it. He thought that Rein and Mari could be friends for an unspecified length of time. A very convincing argument was made by the Schmidas. Rein agreed that Mari was a beautiful girl and that she probably was fond of Rein. Rein had very little experience with the female sex, when growing up. The only family he had was his father.and they had lived like \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo batchelors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He was dating girls that would have him, just for the fun of it. It never occurred to him that these dates might also be a part of the courting game. Apparently time had come to grow up, in the next phase of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoanna realized that she had penetrated Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s naivety and put pressure on Rein. She explained what girls were all about and that he should be more appreciative of all efforts made by Mari to get Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention. Joanna said that Mari was perfect for Rein. Joanna convinced Rein to propose to Mari on the next Christmas Eve in Montreal.  Joanna taught Rein what to do, what to say, etc. That is, Rein was trained in the complete event. But nevertheless Rein was very unclear on how all this would affect is career to earn a living and establish himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein went to Montreal for Christmas. Rein called Tiiu and asked for a meeting. Somewhat melodramatically, this occurred in an abandoned, decrepit, small windbreak building, that had served as the Commuter Train station for Lakeside, where Tiiu lived. Rein forced himself to announce that he had decided to propose marriage to Mari. He had decided that he was a little scared of Tiiu, who came from a middle class family and seemed a little above Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s status. Rein was a poor boy. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he could measure up to Tiiu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectations in a marriage, even if she accepted. By comparison Mari and Rein were more compatible, both poor as church mice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Christmas Eve church service, Rein drove Mari to the top of Mount Royal, to a lookout that gave us a view of all the beautiful lights of the night city. Rein got on his knee and proposed marriage to Mari and she accepted. We returned to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s large Chrysler and for the first time the engine would not start.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually a police car drew into the Lookout parking area and a policeman asked what was going on. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explanation that the car would not start. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yeah, we have heard that one before!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eventually they agreed to push Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s car down the road to The Minuit gasoline station on Pine street. But, Rein had another problem, after that. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the money to pay for the mechanics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bill for installing a new car battery. So, Rein to his embarrassment, hailed a taxi to Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home, which was mercifully close by. He borrowed money from his newly-established mother-in-law, took the taxi back and paid his bill at the garage. He had had to leave his newly acquired fiancee as collateral at the gasoline station. Mari was very brave about it and Rein escaped any comment comment from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home the whole family sat around in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe sitting room\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Hesitently and clumsily, out of his milieu, Rein announced to everyone that he had asked Mari to marry him and that she had accepted. This seemed not to be a surprise to anyone. Kenneth, Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s older brother, home on leave from the Canadian navy, reached behind his sofa chair and produced a bottle of expensive Tattinger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Champagne, to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprise. Ken usually drank Navy Lamb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rhum. We toasted the engagement appropriately. Rein apparently was the only one surprised by this important secret event? Everyone seemed to be calm except Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart (maybe Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heart wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t calm either). What had we done?\\r\\n\\r\\nKenny left the sitting room for what seemed like a long time. Eventually he returned, a little disheveled and streaks of soot on his face.The stove and the kitchen wall behind it had caught on fire. Fortuantely, Kenny, as an able seaman in the navy had been trained in fire fighting and knew how to handle the situation. We were lucky, because behind the flaming wall were gas tanks that could have exploded. For years after that, Rein, under Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protest, made a claim that as a batchelor, he had succumbed in flames.We celebrated with a wonderful Christmas dinner and Rein drove back to London to finish off his MBA degree courses. Greyhound bus packages continued to arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK FIVE: TOGETHER\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does it mean, one year, among many together?\\r\\nWhat does it mean, when deepest needs of life come together?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t                                      --- Mari\\r\\n\\r\\n1963 \\r\\nFirst Woman in Space \\r\\n\"Hot Line\" Established Between U.S. and U.S.S.R. \\r\\nJFK Assassinated \\r\\nMartin Luther King Jr. Makes His \"I Have a Dream\" Speech \\r\\nMedgar Evers Is Murdered \\r\\n\\r\\nThe final term of the MBA was spent completing all course requirements .\\r\\nMost of us spent time on job search. Rein was uncertain as to what he wanted to do next. It did not help that most of the hiring was being done by persons who had no idea what an MBA was. As it happened and became clear (50 years later), the best jobs went to students who were hired by the Canadian banks and financial institutions. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best offer came from Stelco (The Steel Company of Canada). He was offered the job of assistant general foreman on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgraveyard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shift, from 2200 to 0600 in the morning. To make it to the afternoon shift could take 10 years. Rein declined the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein graduated with very good grades: 17 Distinctions (A+), two High Passes (A-), and one pass (B). On an average grade basis this tied him for the Gold Medal with Don Johnston and Walter Schmida. The Business School decided to award only one gold medal to Don Johnson. Rein had left for Montreal and Mari, before the grades came out. He was a bit disappointed in the way final grades were being doled out. But, over the years since, Don Johnson has distinquished himself as a fundraiser for the voluntary sector, as Chair and CEO in the Toronto financial sector. He has had an incredible impact on the tax system in Canada, making it possible for taxpayers to donate wealth, tax free, to not-for-profit institutions. Billions of dollars has flowed to this sector because of his effective lobbying. He has deserved the Gold Metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile at Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place, Rein received a telephone call, the only one in many years from his father. My father had received a letter from the Business School and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what it meant. He thought it was important and urged that I should pick it up. The letter invited Rein to a graduation ceremony and congratulated him for the grades he had achieved. Some sort of an official ceremony was about to be held. They also offered him a contract for 2 years as Lecturer and Case Writer, starting 03.09.63.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 31, 1963 Malcolm X, a black radical, published an important open letter. Convicted of burglary in 1946 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, Malcolm had begun to experience a change of perspective while in prison. He became exposed to the message of Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. His open letter, to the various factions of the black population was accepted positively by all. It was the first breakthrough in Black \\xe2\\x80\\x93 White relations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA negro racial explosion is more destructive than a nuclear explosion.  If capitalistic Kennedy and communistic Khrushschev can find something in common on which to form a United Front, despite tremendous ideological differences, it is a disgrace for Negro leaders not to be able to submerge relatively \\xe2\\x80\\x98minor\\xe2\\x80\\x99 differences in order to seek a common solution to a common problem posed by a Common Enemy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 28, Martin Luther  King, the great US civil rights activist delivered the famous \"I Have a Dream\" public speech, in which he called for an end to\\xc2\\xa0racism in the United States. Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the\\xc2\\xa0Lincoln Memorial\\xc2\\xa0during the\\xc2\\xa0March on Washington, the speech was a defining moment of the\\xc2\\xa0American Civil Rights Movement.\\r\\n \\r\\nBeginning with a reference to the\\xc2\\xa0Emancipation Proclamation, which freed millions of slaves in 1863,\\xc2\\xa0King observed that: \"one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free\".\\xc2\\xa0Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised\\xc2\\xa0peroration\\xc2\\xa0on the theme \"I have a dream\", prompted by\\xc2\\xa0Mahalia Jackson\\'s cry: \"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\"  In this part of the speech, which most excited the listeners and has now become most famous, King described his dreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred. Jon Meacham\\xc2\\xa0wrote that, \"With a single phrase, Martin Luther King, Jr. joined\\xc2\\xa0Jefferson\\xc2\\xa0 and Lincoln\\xc2\\xa0in the ranks of men who\\'ve shaped modern America\".\\xc2\\xa0The speech has been ranked as the top American speech of the 20th century in a poll of scholars .\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were very tense and exciting times in the USA, as blacks and whites and law makers struggled with ancient deeply held prejudices in society. Many protesters and activists were risking their lives. King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech was practically an addendum to the US Constitution, or perhaps a corrective statement. Riots against racism were happening daily in the US South, with white and black \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfreedom riders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trying to break the racist bans in restaurants, toilets, buses, etc. There were lynchings and murders of the protesters. But change started to sweep across the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 31Rein married Mari Ann Paulus at St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Estonial Evangelical Lutheran Church, Montreal. Tiiu was spotted by Mari in the back of the church during the ceremony. A momentous personal time, Rein was fond of them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein arrived a little late at church, because his best man and his friend Ralph Leibe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wolkswagen ran out of gas on the way to the church on the highway. Ralph had forgotten to turn the dial on the spare gas tank to full, when he last filled up the gasoline tank. It apparently had occurred to Mari that maybe Rein wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show up. A little desheviled and worried, he did arrive 10 minutes late. Rev. Raudsepp the professional had us married promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA party was held in the church basement. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stepmother had invited more people than Rein and his father had. This became evident on the receiving line. After the traditional Champagne toast had been made, Rein and Mari wanted to sneak quietly out of the hall and head downtown. They felt somewhat overwhelmed by the number of strangers (more than the majority) that had been invited by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Step-Mother to the party. \\r\\n\\r\\nMuch later in 2014, Rein discovered a message written in the Wedding Book by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Step-Mother: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArm ja Noorus \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 (illegible) \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 neil on taeva v\\xc3\\xb5tmed k\\xc3\\xa4es. Teie ema, Alma Peterson\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. [Translation: Those who have love and youth \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 they have the keys to heaven. Your mother, Alma Peterson.] \\r\\n\\r\\nRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relationship with his Step-Mother had never been a loving one. Perhaps Alma Peterson was trying to reach out to Rein, at this important occasion, and had therefore invited all her friends to the party? Too late now! Rein and Mari were overwhelmed by strange older ladies expressing their opinions on how our marriage should proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were more interested in our friends who had turned up for the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari and Rein snuck out quietly and went downtown to a club called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGaye Paree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, where they were treated to two male singers from Paris, and their duet songs, just what our marriage occasion badly needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had approached the Grand Windsor Hotel and asked for the suite that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip had used. This caused quite a stir. Apparently the suite was under renovation. So Rein asked for the next best suite in the Hotel and it is there that Mari and Rein spent their wedding night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'\\'Some say that no one ever leaves Montreal,  for that city, like Canada itself, is designed to preserve the past, a past that happened somewhere else.\\'\\' ---- Leonard Cohen (1963)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Business School refused to offer Rein a week off, so that Mari and Rein could have a honeymoon at the Stratford Festival.  Therefore, for two weeks Mari and Rein commuted between London and Stratford to see all of the season\\xe2\\x80\\x99s programmes. This included Henry IV Part I & Henry IV Part II, clearly the most boring plays that Shakespeare ever wrote. But a young couple picnicqued on the shore of the Avon River, before every performance, and all went well. After the show they drove back to London, so Rein could get ready for his next day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teaching assignment. I guess this was a Honeymoon with a difference \\xe2\\x80\\x93 love triumphed!\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 22 President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated as he traveled in an open car in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas. We watched the horror on our black and white portable light blue television, called Viking, bought from Eaton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, with money that Mari had saved up.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 1After John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Malcolm X made his controversial speech about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe chickens have come home to roost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at a Nation of Islam rally held in New York. Tension rose in Canada and the USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilan Moravec was a fellow case writer. He had the severest case of a lack of self confidence that Rein has ever seen. Of Ukrainian heritage, he decided to change his personality by copying several of us, including Rein. Rein would notice that he started to sound a little like him, by recognizing his own phraseology and talking habits. This was also noticed by others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Christmas time we celebrated at 3500 Durocher Street in Montreal, where Mari had lived for several years. Two endorsements in our Guest Book stand out. Kenny, Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother, commented, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoping that our fellowship will deepen in spite of materialism, Kenn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother also wrote in the Guest Book: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArusaamine oma vahel on suurem kui ise iialgi suudad anda.

These students were all female undergraduates and came from the Arts Faculty. The area around London was used extensively for farming. So it is correct to say that, by far, most of them were literally farmer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughters. Their dress and demeanor was kind of gauche.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happened is that my fellow rookie instructors had stacked my class by directing all these girls during registration to my desk. A typical prank for our age group, I suppose. I had to politely suggest several times that the ladies should keep their legs crossed. We had some severe problems with the girls to understand the technical aspects of some cases. Rein ended up giving some supplementary study classes, throughout the term. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teaching colleaques thought that this was all a big \\xe2\\x80\\x9choot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nAfter the first break, when the girls could go home, they returned dressed to the nines. Make-ups, hairstyles and whatnot were all first class. Now the tables were turned and my co-instructors were jealous about my bounty of bulchretude. Several of them asked me to introduce them to their favourites and Rein asked the girls about what policy I should follow in this regard. They left it up to Rein to decide. We had become good friends and they were very dependent on Rein to survive their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness course\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein spent the first year writing, at the reguest of his former professors, a case series that covered all the 5 functional areas of business, to be used in the first year MBA introductory class. Rein visited Aylmer Cleaners, where he had made friends during his sewer building escapade. The case series was successfully written as Prescott Cleaners. Barry M. Goldwater had announced his candidacy for President of the USA, in Prescott, Arizona on the day Rein needed a name for his case. Rein also wrote some cases on qeueing theory and sequencing rules for the Production Management faculty, where Albert R. Wood, from Harvard was his mentor.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Wadinambiarachi, from Ceylon, son of a wealthy tea plantation owner, shared the office with Rein. One day Rein noticed that his long name was missing one of the 15letters, to George\\xe2\\x80\\x99s embarrasment. During MBA days, his name was always noticeable on class lists because the person named before him was called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cU\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

His second marriage was to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandmother, he died September 12, 1964 in Seabrook, New Jersey. He (and grandmother) wished to come and live with us. This seemed impossible at this time in our careers. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forgive us and gave away his highly valued \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFreedom Cross\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to a friend at Seabrook.

Both of them were very big believers in psychedelic testing and research that was popular at the time in California. The notion of providing managers with feedback on how their behavior impacted others was novel. We took T-Group sessions from Craig Lundberg, which were supposed to make us more sensitive to how others perceive and react to us. Rein believed that it was effective, but somewhat overstated, as all sorts of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew age\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gimmicks became involved. For example, Milan Moravec tried to use T-Group training to change completely his own (undesired) personality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lundbergs reported spending several weekends of emotional honesty at an Esalen Institute Retreat in California, after which they returned to their life determined to embrace \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree love\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (?) and complete openness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time a controversial U.S. Professor Leary argued that\\xc2\\xa0psychedelic\\xc2\\xa0substances, in proper doses and in a stable setting, could, under the guidance of psychologists, alter behavior in beneficial ways not easily attainable through regular therapy. His research focused on treating\\xc2\\xa0alcoholism\\xc2\\xa0and reforming\\xc2\\xa0criminals. Leary was an early extensive user of LSD and was jailed for it. Many of his research subjects reported profound\\xc2\\xa0mystical\\xc2\\xa0and spiritual experiences which they said permanently, and very positively, altered their lives. In the long-run his finding were were not proved to have lasting benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig and Signe Lundberg convinced Rein to go to the USA to study at a PhD programme. They offered to make contacts and to give us reference letters. Mari and Rein agreed to a tour of the potential University PhD programmes recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe borrowed a sports car (either a TR-3 or Morgan, with the leather strap across the hood). We took Route 81 thruway south from Watertown, crossing the St. Lawrence around Kingston. A heavy rain was pouring down and the relatively small window wipers could not keep up. Rein rolled his window down and tried to drive that way. Mari lost her cool and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop, Rein, I want to get out rather than kill myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein pulled in front of a road sign on the shoulder. The sign said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCortland\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Mari said that we knew someone in Cortland (they were on her Christmas Card List). Their name was Moravec and he had of course worked at The Western Business School. They put us up for the night and convinced Rein and Mari to go and visit the nearby Cornell University Business School. This we did and Rein arrived in the office of the Diredtor of the PhD programme, Prof. Hutchins. He was working on a history book about the railroads. He had books in French, German and Russian on his desk and he was obviously combining the contents into an English text. He asked Rein a question in French and he answered and then he asked another question in German and Rein managed an answer. Finally he asked a question in Russian and Rein replied \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNe panimajut Russky\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, saying in Russian, that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak Russian. This set us off on a very amicable relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continued our travel to Philadelphia and The Wharton School of Business at The University of Pemmsylvania. Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the neighbourhood Mari would have to walk and live in. Then they were off to Cambridge and the Harvard Business School, followed by Yale University at New Haven (who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accept women into the university). Finally we decided not to visit Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. These were all Ivy League universities, part of the life of the Lundbergs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn arriving home we had an offer to come to Cornell and some of the others sent only application forms. When Yale told us that they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accept females, someone had written by hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not by my choice!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the bottom part of the letter. The offer from Cornell offered Rein an Assistantship, the money was very welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalcolm X once again changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz and founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity and the Muslim Mosque Inc. Because of his radically developing ideas, he became the victim of numerous death threats. His home was firebombed on February 14, 1965 and a week later, on the 21st, he was shot and killed in Harlem. Three of those who were later arrested for the murder were identified as members of the Nation of Islam. Unfortunately, he had not yet finished rethinking his evolving  racial philosophy, his beliefs and developing new ideas were incomplete - - had he been afforded a chance, the results might have been interesting and helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaba our first parakeet, whom we inherited from Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother, died during the summer. Babushka flew free in our one bedroom apartment. She enjoyed watching TV football games by sitting on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye glass frame, which weighted down and dislocated the glasses. Baba also liked to drink beer from Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flask, while watching a game. One time, while sitting on the edge of the flask she reached for the beer near the bottom, and fell in. A surprised Rein turned the flask, beer and bird, upside down on the livingroom carpet. A wet and disgusted Baba walked to her cage and demanded to be raised up onto her perch. Humph!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRub-a-dub-dub, three men in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRiley\\xe2\\x80\\x9d made it to London, Ken 02.05.65\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Toast \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Two Years, to hours, two hearts, to flowers, to tears, to smiles, to life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long miles \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.65\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n1966\\r\\nNazi Albert Speer Released From Spandau Prison \\r\\nBlack Panther Party Established \\r\\nMao Zedong Launches the Cultural Revolution \\r\\nMass Draft Protests in U.S. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract at the Western Business School, in May, 1966, Mari and Rein left London, Ontario in a drive-yourself truck with all their wordly goods. At the USA-Canada border they discovered that they needed visas to enter USA officially. The officers said that the Canadian quota at the Queenston border crossing for such visas had been used up. Mari and Rein were advised to go to the Fort Erie border crossing, where there was one more quota for crossing under the Passport of the United Kingdom. Fortunately, Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s British passport was still valid. Rein was instructed to report immediately, in 24 hours, to a USA Office of the Selective Service, because Rein was still subject to being drafted to go to Vietnam for the ongoing War. Fortunately, eventually, at the Ithaca Selective Service Office, Rein was tested and graded a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c4-F\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, because of his poor eyesight. So, all was well now. We were admitted to the USA and Rein was not subject to the Vietnam Military Draft. What na\\xc3\\xafve fools we were at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nArriving at Ithaca, New York, Rein enterd PhD Programme at Cornell University   (Operations Management, Operations Research, Managerial Economics/Econometrics). \\r\\nCornell University\\xc2\\xa0was an American\\xc2\\xa0private\\xc2\\xa0Ivy League\\xc2\\xa0and federal\\xc2\\xa0land-grant\\xc2\\xa0doctoral university\\xc2\\xa0located in\\xc2\\xa0Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by\\xc2\\xa0Ezra Cornell\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the\\xc2\\xa0classics\\xc2\\xa0to the\\xc2\\xa0sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, considered unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell\\'s motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\" \\r\\nThe Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprised of 745 acres, but was much larger when the\\xc2\\xa0Cornell Plantations\\xc2\\xa0(more than 4,300 acres) are included. As well there are the numerous university-owned lands in New York City. The Weill Cornell Medical College has 6,044 full- and part-time faculty on staff. It is located in New York City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscience corridor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d near other health and research institutions including the Sloan-Kettering Institute and The Rockefeller University. Medical school classes emphasize problem-based learning, and early on, students spend class time in doctors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 offices. The Medical College, was founded in 1898. It offers education for a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Additionally, the medical school offers MD/PhD and MD/MBA dual degree programs. There are only 400 students typically enrolled at Cornell Medical College.\\r\\nRein was admitted into The Samuel Curtis Graduate School of Management that imposed no requirements for credits or courses. Instead, students had the freedom to shape a course of study that cut across interrelated field offerings, while working within an academic framework developed with a Special Committee of Graduate Faculty advisors chosen by the student. For this reason, Cornell is especially well suited to those with cross-disciplinary research interests. An A- average was expected in all courses. There we 18 PhD students in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cohort.\\r\\nCornell University itself counted more than 245,000 living\\xc2\\xa0alumni, and former and present faculty. The Alumni included 34\\xc2\\xa0Marshall Scholars, 29\\xc2\\xa0Rhodes Scholars, 7\\xc2\\xa0Gates Scholars,\\xc2\\xa050 Nobel laureates, and 14 living billionaires.\\xc2\\xa0The student body consisted of nearly 14,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 American states and 122 countries, world wide. \\r\\nWe had arrived at Cornell, somewhat na\\xc3\\xafve as to what everything would cost and what the very high academic standards were to be met. But, we had both gone through the Second World War and we were \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurvivors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The tuition fee for Rein was around US$ 12,000. That was the going rate, at the time,   at an Ivey League university. By the time Mari reached her PhD degree at The College of Human Ecology she had Graduate Scholarship and no fees. Her major in Piagetian (Infant) Child Development and Family Studies focused on the understanding of the dynamic interrelations among individual and ecological/ environmental factors as they related to individual development and adjustment. \\r\\nWe found an apartment in the basement of a house that was owned by a Professor of Ornamental Horticulture (gardening), Dr. Pridham, who was a most wonderful person, it turned out. The house was built on a hill and the front part of our apartment was totally above ground, with huge windows, while the back end went into the hillside and had no windows. We had our own beautiful garden in front of our door and a bird feeder that was visible from our large living room window. All around us were huge trees and bushes that made the site very private and verdant. Our address was 111 Halcyon Hill and halcyon it was. The house was called Locust Hill. To get to the parking spot in front of the house we had to go up Warren Road hill, make a very steep right turn up Halcyon Hill to Locust Hill. First time Mari panicked, because as she made the right turn a little too sharply and the front of the car pointed directly into the sky and all she could see from the front window was the sky. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGun it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Rein shouted. She soon learned to make the turn a little wider to avoid the steepest part of the Halcyon Hill turn.We had arrived at Cornell on July 1, by Christmas time we were almost broke, when we forecasted our cash flow for the term ahead.\\r\\nRein and Mari had decided to go down to Cornell, early, so that Rein could brush up on his mathematical skills over the summer. It was recommended, by Prof. Wannacott, of the Engineering Science Faculty at UWO, that Rein take an intermediate Abstract Algebra course.  For two terms, Rein had studied with Wannacott Intermediate Algebra to limited avail.  It almost made Rein want to quit the third level Intermediate Graduate Abstract Algebra course at the Cornell mathematics department and go \\r\\nback to Canada. To this day Rein doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckernel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is in abstract algebra. But he apparently did learn something about abstraction in mathematics. The professor mercifully gave him an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA-\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. No PhD student was supposed to score less than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA-\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a mathematics course. This meant that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see Rein in his classes again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding a job in Ithaca was not easy for Mari, but eventually she became the secretary to Prof. Fox in the French Department. She wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t paid very well. Rein held a Teaching Assistantship, together all this money was less than adequate. We rank ordered the furniture we owned, in the order in which it could be sold \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our marriage bed was going to be the last. In the meantime we started to sell our furniture, including a very dear old broken gramophone that decided to play for the purchaser on cue, who bought it to our surprise. We gave him some old vinyl records as a gift. It occurred to us several years later that maybe the purchaser was more interested in the old \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccollector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s item\\xe2\\x80\\x9d records.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari eventually entered the B.Sc. Programme (Psychology) at Cornell University. Mari and Rein decided that the amount of money that Mari was earning was not going to be worthwhile. If we were going to be broke (we figured this was guaranteed), then to be a little more broke did not really matter in the long run.  So after working for Prof. Fox, for a short time, she applied for her entrance to the undergraduate programme. Her grades at Sir George Williams University were weak. But we were able to concoct a plausible story, including claiming advanced standing on the basis that Canadian courses are the equivalent to two semesters. They made Mari take some intelligence tests and she scored High and was accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only company of any size, within 50 kilometers, was Corning Glass Works (CGW) in Corning, N.Y. Rein noticed that at an upcoming Institute of Management Sciences Research Conference was to be held in Philadelphia. Three people lead by a Dr. J.C. Chambers, Director of Operations Research, Corning Glass Works, were going to present a paper on forecasting. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn desperation Rein drove to Philadelphia, snuck into the conference without paying, and approached Dr. Chambers as he was coming off the podium, after having presented his paper. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Chambers, my name is Rein Peterson and I am a PhD student in Operations Research at Cornell. I need a job!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Caught off guard, J.C. responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should I give you a job?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein stammered an answer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause if you do not give me a job we will starve to death!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This clearly dumbfounded J.C., who turned out to be a decent sort, and he eventually relented and asked Rein for more details about his situation.  Eventually he said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome and see me next Monday at 10 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Later we found out that everyone at Corning was calling him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJ.C.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, because he was a fundamentalist Christian, implying that he tended to act like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJesus Christ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (instead of John Chambers). All this was in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blustering favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday morning J.C. asked Rein whether he could help him choose between 4 mathematical methods of forecasting that had been developed by 4 PhDs in econometrics, all 4 worked at CGW, and turned out to be Sikhs in turbans. Rein promised to do his best. We agreed that the four Mathematics PhDs would present their models and Rein would write a report evaluating the merits of their models. Their models were presented and their level of mathematics was way over Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head. This was all very intimidating. One of the models, especially, seemed to be a lot of nonsense and was called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExperiential Roughing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Later in his academic career Rein discovered, that this statistical method, became a well accepted in mathematical econometric forecasting technique. But at the time, this gave Rein a little self-confidence, and he decided to change the meeting agenda to his favour and started to ask challenging business questions. The longer the process took the more money he earned (Rein figured in desperation).\\r\\n\\r\\nRein decided that the presenters were really abstract mathematicians and had no business knowledge to be retail business forecasters. When he asked the candidates questions, it turned out that none of them knew anything about the products they were forecasting. How could anyone forecast a product without knowing what it was? How was the product promoted and sold, and who were the competitors? Furthermore, they were clearly not using appropriate customer demand data from the market place, but had substituted post-hoc shipments data.  Shipments captured the amounts that Corning decided to ship when they thought they had enough inventory. Shipments made by Corning had no relationships that were actually related to the product demanded by end-user customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n Rein challenged the forecasting candidates as to whether any one of them  knew what the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproduct P-16\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which they were using as an example in their forecasting illustrations, actually looked like. The answer was, no. Rein challenged them about their use of shipments rather than real consumer demand data. It turned out that hey clearly lacked understanding of market channel operations. The were using shipments data, ad hoc, without understanding what it was and where it came from.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his report to J.C., Rein argued that the 4 forecasters were blindly forecasting products using wrong data, and were only massaging complex abstract mathematical equations. Shipments do not reflect fluctuations in customer demand directly,he argued!  Rein reported that he did not like any of the 4 mathematical forecasting models. J.C. was surprised, but agreed that Rein could make a presentation to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week later Rein was invited to meet with the President, Mr. Waterman, who immediately challenged Rein by asking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you are the fellow who can really foretell the future?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This caught Rein off-guard. So he retorted that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that anybody could tell the future, mathematical models or no mathematical models. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir, if anyone told you that they can foretell the future, then, I think they must think that you are a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Apparently this impressed Mr. Waterman. \\r\\n\\r\\n(All his life Rein has been blessed with such ability to retort and to survive in difficult situations. Perhaps this is the legacy of the War years and surviving as penniless refugees.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWaterman asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, what can you do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein replied that there is only one thing that is 100% certain about a forecast, no matter how it is generated, and that is, that it will always be wrong. The only issue is how wrong and what needed to be done about it by management.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you build such a forecasting system?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yes I can, Rein lied, being uncertain of his own capacities. He subsequently became the forecaster for Corningware, and was hired. Working two days a week and supported by 4 clerks, that kept in touch by telephone, Rein and the team produced forecasts for 2 years while Rein was doing his PhD. Once or twice a week he would drive to Corning for meetings. Mari and Rein did not starve. (What a wonderful blessing it would have been if email and internet had been invented by then!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 18 months Rein proposed that he be allowed to build a model that measured Corningware retail sales data at the store level. The proposal was what would subsequently become a part of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PhD thesis. Twelve cities were picked and students were paid at the local universities to sample retail demand, every month, in their cities. This data was mailed to Corning and put on punch cards and processed by the clerks. After 6 months, Rein decided to analyze the data and discovered that what was reported was not \\xe2\\x80\\x9crandom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, but had very definite crude cyclical patterns. It suggested that the student samplers were sending in bogus data and were not sampling actual demand in retail stores, as contracted. Apparently they were making the fictitious numbers up and mailing it in to us fallaciously, without contacting retail stores. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was around Christmas time, and Rein decided to telephone the home of the student sampler in New Orleans. He answered the phone and it was obvious that he had been drinking and a celebration was going on in the background. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy are you cheating on me and not doing any sampling at your retail stores, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that true?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein charged the student. This caught him off guard and he blurted out that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo is the guy sampling demand for you in Los Angeles!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was the end of this research project and also Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first thesis topic. Six months of time had gone down the drain without an opportunity to work on meaningful dissertation research. Over the Christmas holidays some soul searching took place and Rein decided that an empirical thesis was not the best way to proceed. So he decided to try and pursue a mathematical approach, to make up for the lost 6 months. This was a risky decision, because mathematics, of course, was not Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strongest suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe decided to find a mathematical theory book that addressed the issues he had learned about at Corning. It was recommended to him that he study the relatively recent 1960 book entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanning Production, Inventories, and Work Force\\xe2\\x80\\x9d written by Holt. Modigliani, Muth and Simon (typically shortened to H.M.M.S.). After studying the book for several weeks, Rein got lucky. While shaving one morning (no kidding) it occurred to him that the model in the book, written by mathematicians and economists, who probably had no business experience, had made an unrealistic assumption, similar to the Sihks. They had assumed that what was ordered in one period would be shipped exactly the next period. What about stock-outs, when there was insufficient inventory? And even if there was enough inventory, should an effort be made to always ship exactly that which was ordered? What was the optimal shipment quantity within the mathematical model proposed in the book? This was a pure, lucky, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEureka!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moment from Greek mythology.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein sat down and in two hours, with half of his face covered with shaving cream, and was able to mathematically calculate the optimal shipment quantity that had been missed by the eminent authors --- Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon (with contributions by Bonini and Winters). All of these six theoreticians were very famous academics. Could it be that they really had made such a mistake? Two of them subsequently won Nobel prizes as economists and as management science theoreticians (Modigliani and Simon). Rein rushed to Ronald Huefner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place, a fellow PhD student and good friend, and an excellent mathematician, to have him check all the calculations. For once Rein had made no mistakes and Ron and Rein agreed that this could be enough for a dissertation. And this turned out to be the case. Less than six months later, Rein had finished all the writing and had developed a computer model to demonstrate his findings. This was one of the biggest strokes of luck in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. The forecasting work at Corning Glass Works had also been very helpful, indeed. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndirectly, conceptually, and directly by keeping us in food and rent money, this was a banner moment in our lives. We had had to pay two enormous registration fees for simultaneous PhD study, by Mari and Rein, at an Ivey League University. But we made it, with the help of some debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story about forecasting at Corning ended up in a best selling book Rein wrote with E.A. Silver in 1979. The third edition was still in print in 2012 and used around the world. A revised 4-th edition will eventually be prepared .\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, on October 1 Albert Speer, Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous (personal) architect and head of the armaments production during the War, was released from Spandau prison in Germany. This brought Rein back to recent war-time realities. Rein and Mari were very thankful to God for having survived.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good friend Roger Dunbar from New Zealand arrived and subsequently became a well known professor at New York University. But upon arrival in Ithaca he called Rein to come and get him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will find me as the little insignificant fellow sitting, sitting like a bundle, on the edge of the sidewalk in Collegetown. Come and get me, please!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We did, and he was our guest until he got himself organized.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomulus was not keen on visiting us at our various domiciles. Eventually we were able to get him to visit us on Locust Hill in Ithaca. He arrived by bus from Montreal. On stepping off the bus he immediately wanted to know when the busses for returning to Montreal would run. Mari bought the thickest piece of premium steak she could find. She tried to cook it on our tiny Hibachi BBQ grill, on the front lawn of our apartment. It cooked and cooked and cooked \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 with Romulus getting very ancy while sitting on the only garden chair, we had. He had never cooked meat outside on a lawn like this. Eventually a wonderful meal was had by all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTanase paevaga nagin Ithaca ilu, au ja uhkust, mis saab kindlasti kaua minu malus pusima. Tanu sulle Mari ja sulle Rein, ilusa, ilusa paeva eest! \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Isa 08.01.1966\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUks, kaks, kolm.

Rein, angered, replied in an even louder voice \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Raudsepp, we try and try and try every day \\xe2\\x80\\xa6believe me \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not happening  \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 we try, we try \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 !!!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with his loud voice Rein chased an embarrassed Mrs. Raudsepp into the Minister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, to the hilarity of all the members of the congregation in the foyer. Mari was embarrassed by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vindictiveness.  Mrs. Rudsepp had a reputation of meddling in other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nProf. Martin K. Starr, the leading professor in Management Science in the world at the time, published an important book entitled, Production Management: Systems and Synthesis (1964). The book was one of the first written based on systems theory which became very popular and systems theory became the most up to date innovation in management science literature. Rein was very impressed with systems theory and Martin Starr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book. Martin Starr, as a dedication in his book, quoted an excerpt of T. S. Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poem , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurnt Norton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which Rein recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat might have been is an abstraction\\r\\n\\tRemaining a perpetual possibility\\r\\n\\tOnly in a world of speculation.\\r\\n\\tWhat might have been and what has been\\r\\n\\tPoint to one end, which is always present.\\r\\n\\tFootfalls echo in the memory\\r\\n\\tDown the passage which we did not take\\r\\n     Towards the door we never opened \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is, I (Martin Starr) have but opened the door to a new important topic and I am aware that this is but a small step and there are many more doors to be opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein replied with a letter to Prof. Martin Starr, quoting excerpts of verses from later chapters of T.S. Eliot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBurnt Norton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; expressing his admiration for Martin Starr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe wisdom we can hope to acquire\\r\\n\\tIs the wisdom of Humility \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\tWhat we shall call the beginning is often the end\\r\\n\\tAnd to make an end is to make a beginning \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\tWe should never cease from exploration\\r\\n\\tOr end all of our exploring \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\tWe will arrive where we started\\r\\n\\tAnd know the place for the first time \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\nRein, by the poem, was trying to reply that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA journey of exploration starts with the first step and eventually we all will understand better where we had started.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nMartin Starr was very impressed. A prolonged mentorship resulted with the most senior professor in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s academic field. For the second edition of his book (1972), he asked Rein to write a chapter. This was a big honour for a first year student in a PhD programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari graduated 06.12.1967 with B.Sc, from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFar above Cayuga\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waters ...!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nMari entered the PhD Programme, also in 1967, (in Child Development) skipping her Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree. Mari was awarded a National Mental Health Fellowship. Rein was awarded only a Teaching Assistantship, and much less money.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari, initially, was blocked from entering a Masters programme because of a Cornell University by-law, which forbade Cornell undergraduates from entering a Cornell Masters programme. Rein checked and found that there was no such rule for Cornell undergraduates entering the PhD programme, directly. This oversight was viewed negatively by the male Dean of School of Human Ecology, Dr. Devreau. Rein with the help of Mari wrote him a challenging letter, pointing out that he was the only male in a School, whose students were 99.9% female, and added that hopefully he was not exhibiting sexual bias and a lack of understanding. Mari had graduated with a B.Sc. with high honours and was reguired to live in Ithaca because her husband was a PhD student at Cornell. (Rein was at the time the spokesperson for the 18 PhD students in the Business School. Because of the race and gender conflicts of the time, Devreau did not want to engage in any controversy). It later turned out that Devreau had never looked at Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application and it had lain unopened on his desk, for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put Mari through many tests and interviews and she did very well. She was admitted into the PhD programme and was reguired to take some extra advanced research courses to compensate for her lack of an M.Sc. Dr. Devreau also granted Mari a National Mental Health Fellowship Scholarship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Joe, poor Joe, to the army he must go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Joe Churchman, was a fellow PhD candidate. He was off to Vietnam in the US Army 09.17.1967. Joe couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a deferment from the Selection Board and subsequently died in Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12.24.1967 we had our last visit from our friend, whom we counseled and mentored, Satyamurty. Bound by Indian culture he tried to date a US girl. He had a strong cultural, psychological reaction to his own sexual urges. The girl was driving a sportscar and had a head-on accident and was severely injured. About the same time Satya, on his own, had a similar car accident and it became imprinted on his mind, somehow, that he was responsible for the girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accident. Double guilt (sexuality and death) apparently pushed his mind beyond limits and he became a crazy man whom Rein helped to institutionalize and tried to contact his parents in India. The last time Rein saw him, he was naked in a padded cell, ranting and raving, totally out of control. We lost contact with him and Rein wonders what happened to the very nice, unforftunate, man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cForthwith and heretofore, let it be known that now it is four! \\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.1967\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n1968\\r\\nMartin Luther King Jr. Assassinated \\r\\nPrague Spring \\r\\nRobert F. Kennedy Assassinated \\r\\nSpy Ship USS Pueblo Captured off North Korean coast\\r\\n\\r\\nLife was good in the Peterson household. Both of us were very deeply engaged in our PhD studies. These probably were the happiest days of Rein and Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marriage. Life was totally determined by outside expectations and forces and all we needed to do was to perform to our utmost abilities. We were at peace with ourselves, because we were able to meet the high standards expected of us. This was very satisfying.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein finished writing his PhD dissertation and took the first part of his dissertation and submitted it as an arctile for publication, in the top academic journal in his field, Management Science. The Editor-in- Chief of the Journal was Dr. Martin K. Starr. He read the page proofs of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s submission and was impressed and recommended it for publication, after one revision in June, 1969. Martin Starr, as chair of the Management Science Department at the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, offered Rein a tenure track position with the rank of Assistant Professor at Columbia University.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis resulted in a flood of job offers from all over North America. The rumour mill works well in the USA. Mari and Rein set up a system for sorting the offers into three groups and an appropriate reply letter was sent to everyone. All this happened before Rein had defended his dissertation and had been  awarded a PhD. It was a terrifying thought, what if Rein failed his PhD dissertation defense examination? But on June 9, 1969 Rein graduated with a PhD in Operations Management, with minors in Managerial Economics/Econometrics and Operations Research.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Prof. Starr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chagrin, Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree to report to The School of Business, Columbia University in New York City immediately. Instead Rein wanted to take time off to read, by himself, and to write 7 articles for eventual publication. This way Mari and Rein would not be apart while Mari worked on her PhD degree in Child Development Psychology. (When Rein finally arrived at Columbia, Professors Starr and Miller, the two senior professors in his Area, immediately went on sabbatical and Rein ended up teaching their many courses).\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon receiving his job offer from Martin Starr at Columbia University (also a famous Ivey League university), Rein rushed home to Ithaca, victorious and proud, to tell Mari. Mari was watching the TV news reporting that black students had just taken over the Journalism Building at Columbia University in New York, and that the white Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), a radical anti-war (Vietnam) group, had occupied another building. The campus was crawling with intimidating looking New York City cops in full swat gear and with menacing looking guns. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this why they offered you a job?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d teased Mari a deflated, surprised, Rein.\\r\\nColumbia University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan to construct a gymnasium in city-owned\\xc2\\xa0Morningside Park\\xc2\\xa0had touched off negative sentiments on campus and in the Black Harlem community. The design was actually seen as, hopefully, a solution to the gym\\'s physical placement on the park\\'s highly inclined slope. At the bottom of which lived, Harlem and poorer people, who were given a separate access entrance to the gymnasium. At the top was Morningside Heights, a middle-income and Columbia students area and they had another separate entrance. By 1968, 7 years had passed by and the gym\\'s original proposal that had been hailed as mutually beneficial was cast by the civil rights movement into a very different political light. The previously acceptable and pragmatic design was now interpreted as segregationist and therefore discriminatory, and labeled \"Gym Crow\". In addition, others were concerned with the appropriation of land from a public park. Harlem activists opposed the construction because, despite being on public land and a park, Harlem residents would get only limited access to the bottom part of the Columbia gym facility. The top door would be for Columbia students only.\\r\\nSince 1958 the University had been accused of having evicted more than seven thousand Harlem residents from Columbia-controlled properties -- 85 percent of whom were African American or Puerto Rican. Furthermore many of the Harlem residents paid rent to the University. By ownership of a lot of local real estate, Columbia had become one of the largest slum lords in New York City.\\r\\nBlack students also said that their bitterness evolved from discrimination. They complained that, unlike white students, their identifications were constantly being checked. Furthermore it was claimed that black women were told not to register for certain difficult courses. A \"stacking system\", it was claimed, was putting all former black football players in a separate course stream.\\r\\nColumbia University Administration\\'s attempts to suppress anti-IDA (Intelligent Data Analysis) of student protests, on its campus, and against Columbia\\'s plans for the Morningside Park gymnasium, failed. The Columbia SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) activists and the Student Afro Society (SAS) held confrontational demonstrations. Student protesters marched down to the Columbia gymnasium construction site in\\xc2\\xa0Morningside Park, and attempted to stop construction of the gymnasium and began to scuffle with the\\xc2\\xa0New York City Police\\xc2\\xa0officers who were guarding the construction site.The\\xc2\\xa0NYPD\\xc2\\xa0arrested several protesters at the gym site. Columbia SDS chairman\\xc2\\xa0Mark Rudd\\xc2\\xa0led the protesting students from Morningside Park back to Columbia\\'s campus, where students took over\\xc2\\xa0Hamilton Hall, a building housing both classrooms and the offices of the\\xc2\\xa0Columbia College\\xc2\\xa0Administration.\\r\\nAn important aspect of the 1968 Columbia University protests was the manner in which activists were separated along racial lines. During the takeover of Hamilton Hall, 60\\xc2\\xa0African American\\xc2\\xa0Students at Columbia stated that the white students were not wanted in Hamilton Hall. Their position came as a total surprise to the mostly-white, middle class, SDS. While both the SAS and the SDS had the same goal of preventing the construction of the new gymnasium, the two groups held different other political agendas. The goal of the SDS was to mobilize the student population of Columbia against the war in Vietnam, The SAS was primarily interested in halting the gym construction, throughout the duration of the protests.\\r\\nThe members of the SAS requested that the white radicals begin their own, separate protest so that the black students could put all of its focus into preventing the university from building the gym.\\xc2\\xa0As part of a\\xc2\\xa0Black Power\\xc2\\xa0Movement, the African American students claimed that the European-American students could not understand the protest of the gymnasium as deeply, as its architectural plans had been developed in a segregationist fashion. What began as a unified effort would soon become a tension-filled standoff between black students and white students. Soon after, the whites left Hamilton Hall and moved to Low Library, which housed the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\\xc2\\xa0Over the next few days, the University President\\'s office in Low and three other buildings, including the\\xc2\\xa0School of Architecture, were also occupied by the protesters. It should be noted that only a portion of the occupiers were actual members of the University community. Many outside participants flocked to this newest point of revolution to participate, including students from other colleges, street people and celebrities such as Jane Fonda\\'s spouse, fresh from University of California, at Berkeley protests, Tom Hayden.\\r\\nIn separating themselves from the white protestors early in the demonstration, the black protesters forced Columbia to address the issue of race. All this came to be soon after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which had caused riots in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university. Any use of force, Columbia officials feared, could incite riots in the neighboring Harlem community. Realizing this, those holed up in Hamilton Hall, encouraged famous black militants to speak up at their rallies.The black students and their community allies brought an unrivaled passion for their cause. The student-community alliance that was forged, between students of the SAS and Harlem residents, led to widespread growth in white support for the cause, nation-wide.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0Mark Rudd announced that acting Dean\\xc2\\xa0Henry S. Coleman\\xc2\\xa0would be held hostage along with College administrators William Kahn and Dan Carlinsky, until the white student group\\'s demands were met. (Mark Rudd, eventually, according to the press, was actually a diffident, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Boy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, who was pushed to become a minor student radical leader).\\r\\nAccording to the subsequent report, Crisis at Columbia: Report of the Fact-Finding Commission appointed to Investigate the Disturbances at Columbia University in April and May 1968:\\r\\n\"By its final days the revolt enjoyed both wide and deep support among the students and junior faculty...The grievances of the rebels were felt equally by a still larger number, probably a majority of the students...Support for the demonstrators rested upon broad discontent and widespread sympathy for their position.\"\\r\\nHowever, this statement was problematic, as both WKCR (Columbia student radio) and Spectator (student newspaper) conducted polls during the events and immediately afterward. They discovered that while many students sympathized with some of the goals of the demonstrations, a majority were opposed to the manner in which things were being carried out. To that end, a group of 300 undergraduates calling themselves the \"Majority Coalition\" intended to portray most students, involved in the occupations, as not being representative of the majority of Columbia and the adjacent Barnard Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s College students. They were adamant in their opposition to the unilateral occupation of University buildings. They formed a human blockade around the primary building, Low Library. Their stated mission was to allow anyone who wished to leave Low to do so, with no consequence. However, they also prevented anyone or any supplies from entering the building. After three consecutive days of blockade, a group of protesters attempted, on the afternoon of April 29, to forcibly penetrate the line, but were repulsed in a quick and violent confrontation. The Administration feared that Harlem residents would riot and invade Columbia\\'s campus. The Columbia University Administration feared student on student violence. So at 5:00 PM that evening the Coalition was persuaded to abandon its blockade at the request of the faculty committee, who advised coalition leaders that the situation would be resolved by the next morning.\\r\\nThe protests came to a conclusion in the early morning hours of April 30, 1968, when the\\xc2\\xa0NYPD\\xc2\\xa0violently quashed the demonstrations, with tear gas, and stormed both Hamilton Hall and the Low Library. Hamilton Hall was cleared peacefully as supporting\\xc2\\xa0African American\\xc2\\xa0lawyers came ready to represent SAS members in court and a tactical squad of\\xc2\\xa0African American\\xc2\\xa0police officers with the\\xc2\\xa0NYPD, personally cleared the\\xc2\\xa0African American\\xc2\\xa0students out of Hamilton Hall. \\r\\nThe buildings occupied by whites however were cleared violently as approximately 132 students, 4 faculty members and 12 police officers were injured, while over 700 protesters were arrested.Violence continued into the following day with students armed with sticks was battling with police officers. Frank Gucciardi, a 34 year old police officer, was permanently disabled when a student jumped onto him from a second story window, breaking his back.\\r\\nThis became the end of a very unfortunate outburst of student raw feelings of self-righteousness at Columbia University. It was a time Vietnam War protests all over the United States, that indeed put an end to the Vietnam War eventually.  So that, no more young men and women would have to risk their lives in Vietnam.\\r\\nProf. Martin Starr ultimately agreed to wait 6 more months, and Rein accepted the position as Assistant Professor at Columbia University, in the huge and somewhat alien New York City. We lived on the edge of Harlem, in Morningside Heights. The neighbourhood surrounding the university was 99% black or mulatto. We lived at a University protected enclave, at number 400, 119-th Street, on the Southeast corner of Morningside Avenue, called the Butler Hall Residential Hotel. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe decided that it would be safer for Mari to continue living in Ithaca. Rein commuted to Ithaca on a cycle of 10 days in New York and 4 days in Ithaca. Thus, we celebrated our marriage every 2 weeks. Columbia was on a 4 quarter system and Rein had been hired to teach, only two quarters per year. He ended up teaching every quarter for 6 consecutive quarters, to make some money and to fulfill his commitments to Prof. Starr. Vice-President Truman intervened, saying that he was not in a position to pay Rein for working that many extra semesters in such a short period. We agreed that Rein would eventually resign effective December 31, 1970, after teaching two more quarter terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nButler Hall was protected by 4 Police forces, all of whom made their center of operations in our lobby, because Rita, our building nanager, made space available, along with excellent free coffee for all. There was the NYPD, the scary NY SWAT Police, The Columbia University Police, and The 6 building security officers. There were strong iron bars on the first 5 floors of windows. The thugs used them to climb to the sixth floor, etc. That is why the 6 building security officers walked around the building every 5 minutes. Rein, strategically lived on the 5-th floor. On Sunday mornings, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMorningside Patrol\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vigilanty group of male/father volunteers, with leather jackets and two- way radios, conquered the Eastside of Morningside Avenue. Running along the top of the hill, were brush and trees, that reached down to Harlem and could hide persons wanting to attack. Mothers with children and baby carriages enjoyed the sun and leafy environment, next to the park on Sunday mornings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ithaca, where Mari continued her PhD studies, we had a parakeet bird called, Minou. We had agreed to look after him, when Prof. Fox went to France, for sabbatical and to do research on the election bid for President by Charles DeGAulle. On their return from France, we were allowed to keep Minou, who had worked himself deeply into our hearts and life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinou had learned to speak French: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOui, il est jolie le petit Minou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He slept in a cage covered with a towel at night. When he woke up in the morning he sang: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood morning, Minou!  Good morning, Minou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was our signal to remove the towel. He flew free in the apartment all day. He watched TV with Rein, sitting on his tilted glass frame and periodically he snuggled up under Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chin to take a nap. He loved green peas and was taught to keep his claws under the edge of the plate, and to eat them when Rein slid peas toward his assigned surface of the plate. Sometimes he would cheat and sneak over to take one of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peas. He hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learned arithmetic, as yet, and was each time mystified, when caught stealing. At night he did not always want to go to bed and would make us chase him on the living room carpet. Camouglaged, because both were blue with purple streaks, he would laugh: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe-he-hee!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was a game of hide and go seek, until he got tired and wanted to go to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, Minou flew into the lace curtains in the bedroom and got his claws stuck, and then fell to the ground, breaking his neck. He was buried with full honours under the Mulberry bush in the garden. C\\xe2\\x80\\x99est la vie, triste! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFairwell, sweet Mnou! 06.31.68\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lovely couple of days looking at beautiful Ihaca. Thank-you for everything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Les (a rookie policeman), Linda and Baby Carla, 08.19.68 [His policeman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pistol was taken away by Rein and hidden in the apartment].\\r\\n\\r\\nSylvia Opher, Tom Joyce, from Hong Kong, and Gary and Barb Peck from Corning , also found us at Cornell,11.28.68.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristmas, 1968. In Seabrooke, New Jersey, we visited grandmother, Onu (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cuncle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Daniel and Ado, a typical Estonian batchelor from the peasant/farming country. Ado turned out to be a very solid individual, who surprised us with his knowledge of poetry and the Bible. He wore his sincerity very well. All three were reaching their retirement age after working in the Seabrook Farms factory. In retrospect they may have been reaching out to us, for some sort of help in their impending old age.\\r\\nApparently, some serious discussion had taken place, as Vanaema and Ado tried to make us aware of the importance of Christianity and our Homeland Estonia\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSiin voersil oleme oppinud oieti hindama oma kodu ja kodumaad. Ei ole ukski maa nii kaunis, kui oma kodumaa; ei ole ukski nii soe ja armas kui oma kodu. Ei ole ukski keel nii molaline ja ilus kui oma emakeel! Ja mu kodumaa on mulle nuud ligemal kui enne \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ta on nuud mu sudames, mull pole enam muud!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Armsasdele lastele, Vanaema.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTeile, mina ei saa tulla appi, siis annan kaasa selle kepi, et: Jeesust tahan kaasa votta, siis kui teele lahen ma. On mu paastja minu juures, siis voin olla kartmata. Ei siis karda minu hing, kui sa Issand saadad mind, Sinu jalils tahan kaia, iial ma ei jata Sind. Jeesust tahan kaasa votta, kui mull palju voitlemist. Ta voib usku kinnitada, hoida langemise eest. Jeesust tahan kaasa votta, kui mu usk saab proovitud. Ta viib elust, surmast labi, kannab koik mu raskused. Jeesust tahan kaasa votta, koige oma elu sees, kuni ukskord Isamaale, jouan tema armu vaes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Ado\\r\\n\\r\\nIn retrospect, it is clear now, that Mari and Rein had reached a stage in their lives, when they would be heading into a more stable life style. They would  soon begin their life together in a home (by which it was understood a private house) and careers that would eventually bring long-term stability. Everyone probably seemed to sense this and tried to influence our path ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memory there remains a very painful moment. Onu Daniel, Rein loved him dearly, was grandmother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second husband, and as always, he was very direct and honest in his interactions. He asked directly if we would be willing to have him and grandmother come and live with us, as we settled down. Rein answered immediately, that, it would not work because, while we could live with Daniel, there would always be conflict with grandmother, who would want to dominate our lives. For example, Mari was intimitated by her. Apparently Daniel understood this, but was very disappointed with his lot in the future. This was one of the most difficult and painful decisions in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. Daniel was an Estonian War of Liberation hero and had been awarded an Independence Cross, which made him a Kavalier in Estonian society. He still is a personal hero in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel had promised to give Rein his Liberation Cross, upon his death. Apparently, he never forgave Rein, and he gave the cross to a relative stranger, an Estonian man at Seabrook Farms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, I sing thee five songs, one for each year. May the future be bright, and our hearts full of cheer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.68\\r\\n\\r\\n1969\\r\\nPrecursor of the INTERNET, Created \\r\\nManson Family Murders \\r\\nNeil Armstrong Becomes the First Man on the Moon \\r\\nRock-and-Roll Concert at Woodstock \\r\\nYasser Arafat Becomes Leader of the PLO \\r\\n\\r\\nJune, 1969 Rein graduated with a PhD from Cornell University, The Samuel Johnson, Jr. School of Business and Public Administration, Mallot Hall. The BPA School traces its beginnings to the university\\'s founding in 1865. University co-founder\\xc2\\xa0Ezra Cornell\\xc2\\xa0proposed a\\xc2\\xa0Department of Trade and Commerce\\xc2\\xa0for the new university, which was a radical departure from the day\\'s conventional notions about higher education. The proposal was made sixteen years before\\xc2\\xa0Joseph Wharton\\xc2\\xa0endowed the nation\\'s first collegiate business school at the\\xc2\\xa0University of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein started to teach at Columbia University in June, and had an office in Upson Hall. Anti-war demonstrations become a daily occurrence on the Columbia University campus. Some of them were dangerous. For example, some group dynamited the Naval Reserve building where Vietnam bound soldiers were processed. Black gangs came from the slums to raise hell on campus. There were stabbings in the Business School Building elevator, and young teen-aged hoods, black high school students, (probably on a dare) ran sometimes in from one door of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lecture hall and out the other. There were also muggings on the campus at night. Columbia University was 90% staffed by white professors and 80% of the students were also white.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these annoyances, teaching at Columbia was very challenging and enlightening. This was the big time, on the top of the academic mountain for Rein. He met some of the most famous people in his academic field. Columbia as a university was anything but boring and one always felt that he should work harder to keep up with his colleagues, or go listen to some famous visiting person giving a workshop, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein made the mistake of trying to teach Prof. Starr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famous course, as Martin K. Starr did, using his slides and his overheads. Starr was quite an entertainer in class and his classes were dubbed by the students as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Light and Sound Show\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. There was an audio visual technician who sat in a closed-in booth (like at movie theatres) who would put slides on the screen as ordered by Starr. There were some 100 students in the class and Rein struggled to make up a lecture to explain the information on all of  Starr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slides. Unfortunately Starr included some jokes and off-hand comments and drawings which Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. What resulted by Rein, was not even a distant cousin to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStarr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Light and Sound Show\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. After a week, when a slide appeared on the screen that was totally incomprehensible, Rein gave up and announced to the puzzling class that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any idea either what Professor Starr was trying to get across to you. Starting with the next lecture you are going to receive lectures a la Peterson, for better or worse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The class burst out into applause and Rein completed the course satisfactorily. A rookie mistake and a rookie lesson learned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 always be yourself!\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving at 400,119-th Street, required the parking of our car (a modest Ford Falcon) on the street. Every day at 1400 someone had to repark the car on the opposite side of the street. This was a part of living in a New York / Harlem neighbourhood. A senior professor at the Faculty was so astute that he scheduled Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courses so that he could go and move his car. Eventually, Rein paid the doorman to keep an eye on his car and to move it to the other side of the street when reguired. It became clear that the 119-th Street block, from Amsterdam to Morningside, was in the control of all the cooperating doormen working on the street. A side benefit was that you were relatively safe on that block once you turned the corner. Everyone living in Butler Hall, had such small details all figured out.That is how slowly Rein learned to live in Harlem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were a few lessons that we learned on our own. Mari and Rein used to take the subway to Time Square to attend Broadway shows. At first, we would both dress up and Mari would wear her fur coat. This caused quite a stir among Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s colleagues who pointed out that no one wears fancy clothes on the Harlem subway. The subway riders probably were convinced that we were decoys for police officers to catch muggers, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get to our New York apartment, from Ithaca, we took Route 8, that ended at the West end of The George Washington Bridge. Four lanes crossed to the East side and it was absolutely necessary to be on the righthand-most lane to make a very sharp right turn off the bridge onto Riverside Drive, just before reaching a cull-de-sac in scary Harlem. Mari and Rein, each missed the turn, at least once, and had to make the scary detour to get onto Amsterdam and home to Butler Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso across the The George Washington Bridge, westward, was the small town of Hackesnack and Rein was offered by Martin Starr a consulting job, at U$ 700, a day. A newly appointed Executive Vice-President of Operation Research and Computer Science, was badly in need of education on such topics. Consulting jobs were always available at the Business School. But they cut into your research time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari decided to go down to 127-th Street, to the heart of the Harlem drug trade district. There was an art gallery run by Black artists and Rein and Mari wanted to buy there, some art that they called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlack Angry Art\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The logic was that given the riots and everything else going on, this would show how the Black artists were expressing themselves. This would make an excellent memory from our days in New York City. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo Rein talked a Black MBA student, who was also the president of the MBA Student Association, into accompanying them (as some sort of protection). Mari wearing high heeled shoes, blonde with blue eyes, really shone out, as we walked into the heart of Harlem on 127-th Street. Just North of 125-th Street, the Main street of Harlem. Our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuardian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Black Student announced that he was scared. He had never been to Harlem and had always lived in the Bronx suburbs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey probably think that I am a turncoat serving the whities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We arrived at the correct address and were greeted by an unexpected serene scene. A distinguished looking man, who opened the ground floor door to an aging duplex, was wearing white Islamic clothes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was very peaceful music playing in the background and in the heart of  a chaotic, dangerous Harlem, we had found a sanctuary. There was no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cangry art\\xe2\\x80\\x9d anywhere. Everywhere there were just paintings by Black artists of African origin who were celebrating their own personal interpretation of African history, using current milieus. Our host explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe, as artists, try to stay ahead of the prevailing times and milieu, and, remind others that in the future we will need to recognize our proud origins and the true culture of us as African Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are not interested in reproducing the human destruction, pain and chaos, which we see outside our doors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wow! The artists called themselves, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We-Us-I\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (a Tutsi word, Weusi, meaning \\xe2\\x80\\x98together\\xe2\\x80\\x99). They were indeed some 40 plus years ahead of their time. By 2014, Afro-American culture was being celebrated widely by the Blacks. The three paintings we bought became valuable memories and testimonials to our 1969 ignorance, and were displayed on our walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taxi driver who came to pick us up, was a typical very nervous, adamant  New York Jew. When he realized where he was, he admonished us, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are crazy, what are you doing up here? It is dangerous for me up here and for you too, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in a hurry to get the hell out of there. Sweating buckets, as a result, he turned up the wrong (dead-end) side street. Black youths and others started to bang their fists at our windows, roof, and screaming for us to get out of there. A very scared, but experienced driver, was very happy to escape from there. He mumbled to us, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever again\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, upon reaching our home address only 8 blocks away. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe taxi driver was right. That was an unsafe neighbourhood. Close by, on 128 Street there was located The Institute for Child Study, right next to a police station. Mari had insisted, while we were still in Ithaca, that she wanted to finish her PhD in New York City, at this University Institute. She did not want to stay in Ithaca all alone. An argument ensued, with Mari saying that it was a safe place and Rein disagreeing. Rein won the argument. Black radicals, one day blew up the entrance to the police station, next to the Institute. Soon after that our arguments ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, in Upson Hall, where Rein worked, was an adventure. It was at the other end of the long corridor from Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Invariably as he walked down the corridor, an office door would open and some one would exclaim, something like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just got an article accepted for publication in some highly reputable journal!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just landed a speaking tour in Asia!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so forth. Going back to the office from the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room this process tended to be repeated. Rein would arrive in his office somewhat winded, and, then re-double his efforts, to work as hard as his colleagues, on whatever he was doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a week, many of the business school professors met at the Faculty Club, around a big table and shared each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accomplishments. Junior faculty couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t match the appointments to various government, NGO, or corporate boards that the Ivey League, Columbia University faculty were often appointed to. So when the turn came around for Rein to exclaim his big achievement, on most occasions he had to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. (Getting his laundry done that week didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t qualify as a worthy accomplishment with the gray hairs.) But on one occasion he was able to rise to the occasion. Rein reported flying to London between his Monday and Wednesday classes, give a lecture at Imperial College (at the same time as Queen Elizabeth was attracting big crowds to her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchanging of the Guard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ceremony at Buckingham Palace) and he had attracted an audience of 70 persons. He then met with Dr. Edward A. Silver, from M.I.T. and Waterloo, and they agreed to write a book on mathematical inventory theory. He had at the same time met all his classes that week, as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Imperial College, while Rein was giving his lecture on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn Heuristic Procedure for Decision-making\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, someone in the very back row kept asking challenging questions. Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you do this or that? The questioner was convinced that an optimal decision-rule could be developed that was better than Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Heuristic (approximation). Finally Rein recognized the person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice and stepped forward \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis that you, Ed, you should know better than to pick on an old high schoolmate!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll buy you lunch and explain the problem to you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nEd was a distant friend from West Hill High School, he was in the advanced English class and Rein was in the advanced mathematics class. But Ed ended up with a D.Sc. degree from M.I.T. and Rein became a management professor. At lunch it was agreed that the two of them could do an excellent job of writing a compendium of all the mathematical inventory theory research done to date in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with Rein adding always the managerial viewpoint to every theoretical mathematical model, making it usable in management practice. It took 8 years (until 1978) of hard labour to do so. For example, Chapter 5 went through 26 revisions. The book was hailed by everyone as great \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in 2012 it was still in print as a Third Edition. Wow, that was 35 years ago. A fourth edition was being prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari continued PhD studies at Cornell. Rein accepted a 6 month Visiting Assistant Professor appointment at The University of Western Ontario, where he he had earned his MBA. Prof. Albert Wood had been a mentor when Rein was an Instructor at Western. He was going to London, England for a sabbatical to teach at the London School of Business and needed someone to baby-sit his house. Rein was subsequently, offered tenure-track appointments at University of Western Ontario and also at the new Faculty of Administrative Studies at York University, Toronto. Western in London, Ontario seemed to be overly pretentious and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmall-town\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after living in New York City. A former room mate at Western, James Vasoff met Rein in Toronto (during one of his escapes from London) and urged him to come to the new School at York University and that is what Rein did, eventually.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 28\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProf. and Mrs. Peterson:\\r\\nTo be warm-hearted without being sentimental, to be detached without being unconcerned and yet have the ability to create and enjoy beauty are the qualities which I enjoy in you. I know not who paints pictures on memories canvas, but whoever he may be, what he is painting are pictures and not writing history. By this I mean that he has no compunction in putting into the background that which was to the fore, or bringing to the forefront that which was beyond. All I can say is that my short stay in Ithaca will be one of the happiest memories I will have in USA. It is reassuring to know that people all over the world are basically generous and warm-hearted, Thank you! Prabhuling Patel, Bangalore, India.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPrabhuling was from a very important Indian family, studying for his MBA at Cornell. He and his father helped repatriate Satyamurty (the one who had gone mad) to his family in India. At Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reguest, his father brought an expensive, beautiful purple sari for Mari, past the border controls. When challenged by the US border guards, he drew himself to his full height, of more than 6 feet, raised his magnificient bearded chin and said in an annoyed voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are my religious vestments!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSix and we are apart, yet more together in our separation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari wrote in 08.31.69\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n1970 \\r\\nAswan High Dam Completed \\r\\nBeatles Break Up \\r\\nKent State Shootings \\r\\n\\r\\nRein accepted an Assistant Professor rank at $14,000 per year, effective September, at The Faculty of Administrative Studies, York University, in Toronto, Canada. Rein was offered by Dean Gillies a tenured Associate Professorship, but he declined (proudly) saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, Mr. Dean, can offer me more money. But, Mr. Dean, tenure can only be offered to me by my colleagues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Appointed Assistant Professor (Management Science), Faculty of Administrative Studies, York University, Toronto, Rein commuted between York University, Toronto, Western Business School in London, and Columbia in New York City during two academic quarters to fulfill 3 overlapping contracts that he had signed. The money became very handy.\\r\\nOne of a matching set of pottery lamps was broken by the movers and Rein raised hell with the York University Treasurer about replacing both of them. After an argument that ended in a draw, the Treasurer, called Clements, suggested that Rein should worry more about his taxes, than about a broken matching set of lamps. He recommended an excellent Toronto-based tax accountant (his friend, presumably). This turned out to be a major stroke of luck. Since Rein had three contracts in five different tax jurisdictions (U.S.A., New York City, New York State, Canada, Ontario) a good tax accountant could do some tax saving magic. His master stroke was to get Rein a benefit from the Federal government, who were encouraging the return of Canadian academics to Canada (because of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrain drain to the USA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The tax accountant saved us enough money to allow us to be able to comfortably pay a sizable down payment on a house. Rein does not remember his name, but he was a saving angel, who at the end of the transaction asked Rein, somewhat shyly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould a $ 400 fee be unreasonable?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein was so excited, that he actually was willing to split the considerable tax saving 50/50 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but for once he kept silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari had arrived in Toronto, somewhat depleted financially. But as a result of the tax accountant, they were able to buy a one-and half-story 4 bed room Cape Cod type house at 14 Hilldowntree Rd., in Humber Valley Village, immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein worked with Voitto Ulikorpi (Finnish) to build a sauna in the basement. Voitto, a skilled carpenter, became a good friend and corrected Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carpentry mistakes and renovation conundrums. We both loved the cases of beer that helped the relationship. For the first time, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEngineer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein, actually buildt a straight wall for a cool room in the basement, all by himself. A great victory after years of doing project management and abstract design on construction sites. Mari was impressed. Voitto spent so much time at 14 Hilldowntree with Rein, that his wife called Rein and begged him to convince Voitto to quickly repair the roof on his own house, which was leaking. On February 12 Mari invited her and Voitto for dinner to smooth over things.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein publishesd his first article from his PhD thesis, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOptimal Smoothing of Shipments in Response to Orders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Management Science Journal, the top-ranked academic journal in his field. This was considered a major accomplishment for a young academic, especially if he was publishing the main findings of his dissertation. Rein pointed out, mathematically, that the famous economists Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon had in their new book overlooked an important aspect of their theory. Three of these four authors each eventually won a Nobel Prize. This was considered by some as a significant academic faux-pas. A number of controversies and commentaries followed, that were aroused by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggested corrections and findings. All of this contributed to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, Dr. Sam Eilon, the ranking Management Science academic in the U.K., challenged Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings by concocting a game-theoretic argument, saying that it was impossible to smooth shipments. A professor Evans, from the USA, pointed out that if Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings held, then, it should be possible to reduce aggregate economic cycles by 40%. While Charles Holt, the Director of the Urban Institute in Washington, and the lead-author of the HMMS (Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon) Aggregate Production Planning Theory admitted that Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings were indeed on a significant error discovered in their theory. He wrote to the Economic Council of Canada and urged that they give a research grant to Rein to further develop his theoretical work. But Rein was not a Macro-economist and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to proceed from his mathematical findings. Blush! He had stumbled on some significant findings from another academic field, somewhat unknowingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein published a second paper, from his dissertation, as an Academic Note in The Management Science Journal. He pointed out with a mathematical Lemma, that it was impossible to construct an optimal forecast, because optimality was always a function of a convex linear combination of several predictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the beginning of the Stagnation Era under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Rampant shortages and rule by jowly, gray-faced men ensued in the Soviet Union. It was, said historian Anatol Lieven, an era of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfaceless bureaucrats playing an endless game of musical chairs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moving from the directorship of one department or factory to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Town of Mississauga (a former suburb of Toronto) was created in 1968, and the City of Mississauga was incorporated in 1974, through the amalgamation of the Town of Mississauga and the villages of Port Credit and Streetsville. Today it is Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sixth largest city.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was hired by the City of Toronto to carry out a statistical analysis of residential houses in a district, so that this information could be used to set residential property tax rates. Subsequently, as a result, Rein was hired as a statistician/analyst/consultant byBruce McLaughlin who ultimately became known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe man who built Square One\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the downtown centre of Missisauga. \\r\\n\\r\\nMcLaughlin envisioned that his creation would become the city center of Missisauga. McLaughlin, a longtime Mississauga resident lived for many years in a Spanish-style mansion beside the Mississaugua Golf and Country Club. His developer\\'s long-range thinking and planning were way ahead of everybody else. He was thinking years down the road. He had the foresight to see that there would be major growth west of Toronto, partly because of the Malton/Pearson airport. McLaughlin was already planning a major development on his huge holdings near Burnhamthorpe Rd. and Hurontario St., when a fire at the municipal offices at Confederation Square in Cooksville in 1969 provided an opportunity to cement his lands as the future downtown core. At the time, Rein saw McLaughlin as a wild dreamer, but today he appreciates the talent and vision his former employer held. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s short-sightedness is evident, every time he drives West, from Toronto, toward downtown Missisauga. In 2014, at the retirement of 12 term, 32 year mayor, Hazel MacCallion ( at the age of 93 years) the population had reached 830,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 31.

Protesters had moral and legal arguments against the war, and were vehemently opposed to the Draft, or forced military service. Approximately 20,000 Americans dodged the draft by escaping to Canada and of those who were drafted, approximately 12,000 deserted. \\r\\n\\r\\nEconomically, rising inflation prompted governments to enact wage and price controls. In1973\\xc2\\xa0OPEC Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, declared an embargo on oil exports to North America and many Western European nations, causing an oil crisis. This led to supply shortages and higher oil and gas prices. Consumers demanded smaller cars, as some governments reduced speed limits. Foreign car makers had an edge in the compact and sub-compact market, and for the first time, imported cars\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as the Honda Civic\\xe2\\x80\\x94gained popularity in the North American car market.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein always left his office door ajar. The office was located at the very end of a long corridor. Students visited often to discuss academic matters and also their personal life. Many of them were from family businesses and had issues, such as, whether they should join the family business upon graduation. Typically they would be reporting to their father, the President and sole shareholder. Almost all of them were facing potential conflict with a dominant (loving) father, who held power over them. These meetings eventually became once a week workshops that the students labelled as being discussions about  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat To Do About Daddy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\nThis was the naissance of the Entrepreneurial Studies Programme at The Faculty of Administrative Studies, York University. It also became one of the first academic Entrepreneurship programmes in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was also teaching everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s least favourite course, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIntroduction to Statistics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Room 142 of Ross Hall. There were some 50 students in the class and Rein flunked approximately 25% of the class, the first year. This created a bit of a crisis. Rein received a telephone call from Dean Gillies, who demanded to know, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Rein, did you flunk so many people?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Caught off guard, Rein blurted out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause they were stupid, Sir!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As if this were a surprise also to Dean Gillies, he responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh I see, please come to my office, we have a problem!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It turned out that 12 of the students, Rein had flunked, were black Kenyan civil servants from Africa, and part of the Faculty aid programme sponsored by the Canadian government. Rein had wiped out the entire aid programme by flunking them all in a honours programme. It turned out that all Gillies was worried about was what to do next? Rein offered to teach a workshop for the students during the summer, for which the African programme paid. Some of the white students also took advantage of the offer. As an afterthought, apparently the standards at Columbia University, were higher in 1971, and Rein had not adjusted his approach to the course. Jim Gillies respected all that, he was just a problem solver, not just a Dean and Rein was learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWasniarsky and Finklestein, were two students in that class, always sitting in the first row. Wasniarsky, was burly and had an Afro-style hairdo and an unruly beard. He was specializing in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArts Administrarion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He had very little talent or interest for mathematics and statistics. He ultimately became a well-known Canadian theatre manager. Finkelstein had shaved his head bald and was a very skinny nervous type and apparently easily intimidated. At the beginning of the course, Rein got the two names mixed up. (All his career, Rein struggled with keeping students names straight).Wasniarsky had a weird sense of humour. When Rein called him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinkelstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, at row call, the first day, he answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes Sir!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  There was laughter among the class.This left one more name on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s class list and he turned to Finkelstein, who sat in front and Rein said assuredly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose that means that you are Wasniarsky !!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The class tittered again, and Finkelstein mumbled quietly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Sir!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nThis continued for most of the term, until the second class test was returned by Rein. Wasniarsky, an arts administration major, had received a failing grade on both of the two tests. When Rein handed the failing tests to Finklestein, he finally, stood up, and stammered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not Wasniarsky, Sir!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To which Rein shouted back, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes you are, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got your name attached to your face in my memory!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The class was in hysterics. At which point Wasniarsky stood up and admitted his ruse. Rein never again wanted to be caught in such an embarrassing situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was appointed Director of the Bureau of Research and The Ford Foundation Research Grant Fund. Rein hired Margaret Styles to help him write the final report to the Ford Foundation, which turned into an exercise in fantasy concoction. The available records were a mess. Nevertheless it can now be reported that Ford Foundation helped change the research culture at the Faculty of Administrative Studies. The Ford Foundation was not interested in book keeping. They were satisfied with the result.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein fired the Assistant Director of the Bureau of Research. In 1973 he eventually proposed to the Faculty Council that the Bureau had served its purpose and should be closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was elected as a Governor on the National Board of Governors of the Canadian Junior Achievement Association. JA encouraged high school children to learn about the Capitalistic/Market system and they provided working managers to help and mentor the children on how to start and manage their own businesses. There were chapters right across Canada in most cities. On the Board Rein was brought in contact with the elite of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Canadian industry and Bank Presidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein, while attending the International Institution of Management Science, at Detroit, asked to be allowed to address the Annual Meeting of the Society. He pointed out that the label \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternational\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a misnomer in the Society\\xe2\\x80\\x99s title. No \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternational\\xe2\\x80\\x9d researchers had ever served on the Council, not even from your neighbours in Canada. This obviously stung the membership and the Council. Rein was elected as a Council member, with responsibilities for International Affairs. As a result, he became the Programme Chairman of TIMS Annual International Meeting to be held in Kyoto, Japan in 1975.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicha(t) and Winston, a cat and a dog,  joined our family in 1971.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEight \\xe2\\x80\\x93 too late, Brings with it a nine month wait ! \\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.71\\r\\n\\r\\n1972 \\r\\nPocket Calculators Introduced \\r\\nTerrorists Attack Israeli atheletes at the Olympic Games in Munich \\r\\nWatergate Scandal Begins \\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 10 Rein, founded and was elected the Founding President of the Ontario Chapter of The Institute of Management Sciences. It was the first Canadian or International chapter in the world. We called it the Southern Ontario Capter of The Institute of Management Sciences (SOTIMS), with meetings held monthly at The Science Centre, in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 4 Faculty Wives Club Dance took place at the Atkinson College Common Room. Rein lit a fire in the decorative (fake) fire place and the building was evacuated  by the Fire Department, because of the smoke. OOPS!\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 20 Rein and Edward A. Silver of Waterloo University agreed to spend the summer working on their new book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDecision Systems for Inventory Management and Production Planning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Most of the free time each day was already being allocated to writing draft chapters that we assigned to each other. Before the 20 chapter book was finally finished, eight years of time had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein requested permission from the TIMS Council to publish a Special Issue of the Journal, Management Science, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Science in Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He would serve as Editor-in-Chief and all the authors would come from Canada and would have their academic papers whetted by the regular process of peer review. The TIMS Council agreed. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal had the backing of Martin K. Starr, who at that time was President of TIMS.\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKoik minu pardikesed ujusid vees (Kenn, Carla, Lisa, Linda, Ema).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston was a fluffy, middle-sized, black and white dog. Very friendly and the children called him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWinnie the Booh\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, when she was a puppy. He had no name when we rescued him from the pound. Mari and Rein were working during the day and we decided to tie Winnie to the garage door and let him enjoy the freedom of the driveway. The little children on the way to/from school loved him, but the older children started to tease him and mistreat him. He became very cross, before we really knew what was happening. He became very watchful of our property and patrolled it free, off a leash, counter clockwise, when we were home and outside. We now called him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWinston\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in keeping with his more distinguished looks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur neigbours were the Skeltons. Mr. Skelton was the president of Cara Foods Ltd. Rein on a high ladder, using an electric hedge trimmer, was trimming the hedge between our properties. He noticed out of the corner of his eye, Winston stealthily sneaking up on Mr. Skelton, who was bent over weeding in his garden. Winston bit him on the inside thigh and ran off. All hell broke out, as Winston yelping retreated to his own yard, Mr. Skelton screaming out in pain, and Mrs. Skelton, a nurse, yelling and shouting at Rein, while calling for an ambulance, to get Mr. Skelton a tetnus shot. In all this confusion, Rein fell off the high step ladder, cutting the lectrical cord in two, on the way down.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had started to keep Winston in the breeze-way between the house and the garage. Apparently, one day, Mr. Skelton had noticed that Winston, had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cescaped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the breezeway and was loose on our grounds, patrolling counter-clockwise. With considerable difficulty, he had chased Winston back into the breeze-way, with a stick, and locked the breeze-way door. Winston did not take kindly to Mr. Skelton, after that, and saw an opportunity, a few days later, apparently tried to even the score.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after, Winston attacked our new baby-sitter, when she was trying to enter through the breeze-way. Rein was fortunately able to stop Winston before she could do any damage, but this, unfortunately, lead to Winston\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demise.  Rein had to have him euthenized, a sad end to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend and protector.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, we bought the rump of a Beagle litter at the local pet shop. She was called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGypsy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. She liked to track any \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuspicious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d odour, she found on the ground. Her concentration was enormous and it was hard to distract her once she got locked in on an odour trail. She was indeed a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGypsy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and we had to search for her many times.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein offered the first formal Entrepreneurial Studies course, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMBA Seminar on Career Planning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Approximately 30 students, mostly from family businesses, were in attendance. This was an entrepreneurial class because the interests of the students split among those who were wondering how to rejuvenate the family company, when it became their turn to assume leadership and those who wished to start their own business, on their own. We became one of the first \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacademic entrepreneurship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d course start-ups in the world, and we eventually became recognized as such. \\r\\n\\r\\nMay 11 Michael Daniel was born at Western Hospital. We had practiced taking the route from our house to the Western Hospital. Our route took us North, up Spadina Rd. and Rein had to turn left at the bright Westway Theatre sign. Unfortunately, the florescent sign, on the theatre, was turned off that night. With Mari, shouting, her feet on the dashboard,  screaming we were able to make it to the emergency room at Western Hospital. Mari wanted Rein to be in the birthing chamber as the birth took place and Rein got the permission from the authorities. Upon entering the room a giant nurse, looking like a block of granite, informed Rein that she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t approve of men in the birthing room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you faint and fall on your head and crack your scalp, I will ignore you and just step over you. The mother and baby come first!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein had no intention of breaking his scalp open nor fainting, but this admonition struck fear into his mind. All went well and Dr. William Dymon, our friend and long time doctor delivered the baby. Rein was there on a mission, at Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request. After the baby was born, he boldly stepped up to the table on which little Mike was being cleaned up, and counted 10 toes, ten fingers and he seemed to be well hung, Rein thought the baby was just beautiful. He relayed this information on to Mari and congratulated her for gifting Rein with a magnificient son. We both welcomed Michael Daniel with tears of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 23 Michael was christened, at 14 Hilldowntree, by Estonian Lutheran Minister (later Bishop), Andres Taul, a friend of Mari from England. Michael was chosen by Mari, who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want a name that others could shorten and make it sound derogatory (and she then ended up calling him, Mikie ?). Daniel was chosen in the memory of Daniel Andreiman, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite uncle and a Kavalier of the Estonian War of Independence (1918 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1920).\\r\\n\\r\\nReimar Associates Incorporated was founded, as a personal consulting company for Rein and Mari. Rein was active in consulting: Forecasting Seminars, Scheduling system for Sun Oil Company fuel oil delivery trucks, Inventory system for a gypsum company, Canadian Forces School of Management in Montreal, Series of workshops in the slums of Buffalo, paid for by US government, Multiple Access Company, Ceiba-Geigy, and several other assignments, in subseguent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari was advising Day Care Centres and Working at Canadian Mothercraft, on Heath Street. She was a popular lecturer at various venues and became a member of the impressive societal Board of Victorian Home Care Services. We both were very busy outside our formal jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein also became the most active lecturer at the Faculty Executive Development Programme. He had published a paper, while at the Western Business School, in the Business Quartely, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCritical Path Scheduling: A Comprehensive Look\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, it became a best seller in reprints, for the next decade. Rein because of it to many invitations to lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNine, divided by three, equals three, and so are we.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.72.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1973 \\r\\nU.S. Pulls Out of Vietnam \\r\\nU.S. Vice President Agnew Resigns\\r\\n \\r\\nPrevious year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s popular Entrepreneurship Seminar actually consisted of two interest groups of students, and therefore two new MBA courses had to be launched: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEntrepreneurship and Small Business\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew Venture Formation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Mara Shore of Lake Simcoe, was located Voitto\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cottage which Rein and Mari rented part of the summer and Ed and Maxine Silver joined us. Rein and Ed worked on their book in the secluded sauna. Rein, partly because of pride, spent almost a month in critiqueing Ed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chapters to prove that he had some mathematical knowhow. Some heated arguments resulted, but by the end of the summer, no work got done on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chapters and he suffered severe time pressures as a result, during the next senester,to catch up. He also learned about controlling his ego, a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summer was so pleasant otherwise, that Mari and Rein bought a property from farmer Hodsoll, on the East/Mara shore of Lake Simcoe, just past the little village of Riverside, the entrance to a small canal, and 3 kilometers north of Beaverton, Ontario. Everyone else started to build winterized houses on their properties. There was a petition to build sidewalks and improvements to the road. The original cottage style location was becoming a little too civilized for Mari and Rein. Three-car garages were being built by neighbours. We decided not to build a cottage there and sold the property after 3 years of enjoying the private steep shoreline of our property on day trips.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in 1970s a new Dean was appointed, who came from California. \\r\\nDr. Barry Richmond was very demonstrative and arrived in a fancy yellow BMW sports car. He had acquired new liscense plates labeled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYORKU\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He was not a good fit with our Faculty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s culture and stage of development. Rein, as Chair of Faculty Council came in contact with him often. It seemed that he himself subsequently changed his mind about being a Dean. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t used to all the bureaucratic and political shenanigans, and seemed to lack the skills needed to build up a quick personal network of colleaques who would help him with the political and bureaucratic tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, in 1973, Barry Richmond, while in California, resigned by telephone and sent a letter of resignation. He, himself, only appeared at the Faculty several weeks later. This caused a major crisis and chaos at the Faculty. Several political fellow professors were maneuvering fast to try and establish a new Dean from their faction.  Rein, as Chair of Faculty Council became embroiled in the situation.  As the Chair of Faculty Council, Rein ruled that according to the University rules, an Acting Dean could only be named by the President, and it was his responsibility to see that this happens. Brian Dixon was named by the President as Acting Dean, until a new Dean could be appointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Rein was in the Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Room, at the middle urinal, Brian Dixon and Wallace B. Crowston pulled up to adjacent urinals, on either side, and tried to pressure Rein into becoming an Associate Dean. Rein said he was reluctant to take on any more responsibilities at the Faculty. Bur it was eventually decided that Wallace would become Associate Dean-Academic and that Rein would accept the Associate Dean of Students, until a new Dean would be appointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from being appointed Associate Dean, Rein was also appointed Full Professor (Management Science), the latter appointment was to protect Rein in future political reprises. The urinal transaction was not really a practical joke. Rein was to experience a similar situation as Vice-President at Cape Breton Development Company, in 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Dixon was a sculptor, his work was valuable and Mari and Rein bought a piece of his work. Somewhat surprisingly he was also a Professor of Marketing and a good administrator. But his artistic nature would tend to dominate. Brian Dixon, as Dean, was mercurial in his behavior. At meetings with the various university committees, he could suddenly explode and express his counter-opinion loudly. Often, after such events, he would storm out of the room, leaving Rein alone to make amends, as best as he could. This was not always easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Associate Dean, Rein had 11 persons reporting to him, in a complex of offices, including a corner office for himself. It became apparent that the current Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, a non-academic, Don Hathaway, had been running the office complex, with very little supervision or input from Council or the Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office. He had abrogated the responsibilities of the Associate Dean and sat ensconced behind the Associate Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desk and implied that he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to go anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat weekend, Rein and Wallace Crowston, moved all of Don Hathaway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s files and books from the Associate Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office to an office in the basement. On Monday morning, Rein sat behind his desk and met with the senior managers in the Associate Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, they were more than happy to be rid of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalf-of-way Hathaway\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Not surprisingly, Hathaway eventually resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein asked the 3 senior mangers to come to his office, and asked as to what were the major problems of the Student Affairs Department. The answer was shocking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to be able to do a good job of registering students and then monitoring which students have fulfilled the requirements needed for graduation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent investigation we discovered that 8 students had graduated with less than the 20 course regurirement being satisfied. Rein personally telephoned each one of them and threatened them with loosing their graduate standing, unless they came back and satisfactorily finished the courses that they were lacking. All 8 students complied and Rein did not take any further action against them. It also became evident that, Karen, who was responsible for calculating and cheking the numerical reguirements for entrance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like working with numbers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Karen was terminated and Rein was able to place her in another job in the University. She cried in the office and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wanted to be a ballerina, but I hurt my back, severely, and I had to stop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was blessed with an excellent secretary. But it turned out that she was younger than the minimum age reguired by the Government. We jointly boycotted any action that was attempted and she survived until the reguired birthday. The Associate Dean was responsible for dealing directly with students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 problems. We set up a system of 15 minute periods for meeting each of the students. There were a large number of students reguiring to see the Associate Dean. Typically, she would come to the door and give Rein a slip of paper that summarized the probable action that Rein would have to formally take. If it was a congradulation for winning some award, she would seat the student among the flowers and plants at the end of the office. Rein would then come and sit next to the student and deliver the accolades. If a student problem was a negotiation, Rein would sit officiously behind his desk and stare at the student. If there was an unreasonable confrontation, about to happen, she would open the door a crack and say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you come to the door Dr. Peterson?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rein would come to the door and say, loudly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  This system, was dependent on a wise secretary, and it worked effectively to deal with the horde of students, most of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo incidents remain in memory. By some quirk of fate, the Associate Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office managed to post an announcement, cancelling the upcoming \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReading Week\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or vacation. A minor student riot ensued among protesting students behind the Associate Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office door. Informed that the announcement was not warranted, Rein went and faced the student protesters. He delayed and answered various complaints and then suddenly announced that the reading week would be reinstated. Rein became an undeserved hero. The student officers presented to Rein, subsequently, a pen set, the engraved plate from which still hangs on his wall. The President of the MBA Association became a hero, for his own role in the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sad memory lingers. A man of 50 to 60 years of age, from Hungary, had been unable to keep his grades at the minimum amount reguired. Even if on the remaining 3 courses he could gain an A+ grade on all 3 courses, his cumulative average would be unacceptable. The man was a 1952 Olympian for Hungary in water polo and he was very proud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease give me another chance!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  he cried on his knees, with his hands clasped in prayer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will be so embarrassed before my children and wife, I cannot bear it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was literally crying. Rein stood up from behind his desk and shouted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am an Estonian and you are a fellow Ugro-Finn, get up off your knees and show some pride. You embarrass me. I cannot help you, it is too late. Get up and go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  At that my secretary opened the door and escorted the sobbing man out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Information Counter in front of the suite of offices was staffed by a young woman who had a very large bosom. The boys came in to tease her and she enjoyed teasing back. There was always chaos at the desk and mistakes were made. Rein terminated her contract and hired a middle-aged no-nonesense woman, who had been in the US Peace Core. All confusion stopped, as she started to rule the front desk with authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total Rein terminated a total of 13 employment contracts, including Hathaway, meaning that some positions were terminated more than once. Rein eventually proposed to the Operating Committee that the position of Associate Dean of Students be replaced by a non-academic. Charmaine Courtis was hired to become Executive Director of Student Affairs and also of the Placement Office. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharmaine and Rein worked in parallel for some months, before Rein resigned. For the record, let it be recorded, that, Rein acted chauvinistically. Charmaine was a good looking young girl/ woman and started to date a faculty member. Rein asked her to come to his office and warned Charmaine about dating faculty members. Rein was afraid that she would be taken advantage of. She eventually married Prof. David Dimick and effectively managed the former Associate Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office for 40 years, before retiring. Prof. Dimick, eventually, became the Accociate Dean- Academic. They worked effectively in tandem and engaged in no collusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Editor-in-Chief of the Management Science Journal Special Issue, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Science In Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Rein contacted every known person in Canada, who he believed to be able to produce a worthy research paper. He worked hard with David Conrath (Waterloo) and Chris Janssen (Alberta), two co-editors, to put together a set of papers that proved that Canadian management science researchers were as good as anyone in the world. Prior to this, Canadians were afraid to send papers to the Management Science Journal for review and instead sent the papers to the Canadian operations research journal called INFOR, which was rated as a lower quality journal. The Special Isseue was published as Volume 20, Number 4, December, 1973. The Canadian Special Issue became the model for other special issues published subsequently by TIMS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Preface Rein wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a general lack of published papers on successfully implemented Management Science projects. Whether this is because most of the consulting results are of a proprietary nature or because we have paid too little attention to them as a profession (the problem, once analytically solved, loses our interest) is unclear.But a general acceptance of Management Science by decision makers is unlikely to take place without the accumulation of a large number papers on successful applications\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein recalls, with regret, a French-Canadian author, whom we encouraged and helped, but whose Canada-oriented application applied paper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIcebreakers on the St.Lawrence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, failed to meet the standards of the referees and as a result was not published.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was appointed Area Co-ordinator (Management Science) and became a member of the Operating Committee. He also was elected the Chair of the Faculty Council and Chair of the Executive Committee (and in subsequent years of his career he was re-elected 17 times. An explanatory \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjoke\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, made by Rein, was that all political factions in the Faculty hated him equally, making him the ideal compromise, as an unbiased Chair of Council).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 28 the Hon. Margaret Birch, resposnsible for youth employment in Ontario, visited the Faculty and offered a government grant. Rein organized the York Small Business Advisory Programme, which started to operate like a consulting company. MBA students offered advice for small business clients at low prices, under Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervision. Eventually, the Programme expanded over the years to having more than one million dollars in sales and eventually resulted in the establishment of Enterpise York, the York Enterprise Centre. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve added a zero, had some fun, bought some land, and played with our son. A decade passed and ten years more will make it twenty to even the score\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6.

Hockin asked Rein to be Academic Associate Dean, but, Rein declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein agreed to find a new Associate Dean, to replace him upon resignation. Rein took his friend Tom Beechy (Professor of Accounting) to lunch at the only reasonable looking restaurant outside York University grounds, The Colony Restaurant. It turned out to be a strip joint. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Tom and Rein were starting to eat their meal, an overpainted woman pranced onto the restaurant floor. She walked to the large juke box and inserted 25 cents, and chose a tune. At that point she started to gyrate from table to table. Rein and Tom were attempting to have an academic discussion. It took good fortune and a patient Tom Beechy to eventually relent (so that we could escape from the Colony Restaurant). Tom proved to be an excellent Associate Dean, Academic for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 19 Rein made a presentation to the Faculty Advisory Council. He also conducted interviews with the press, helped with recruiting new students and reported to the Alumni Club about the progess being achieved at the Faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 1 Rein, Mari and Michael were invited by Hickling-Johnston Consulting firm to go alpine skiing at Collinwood. Rein served on their advisory committee and became close friends with several persons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormally, a Special Programme in Entrepreneurial Studies was established at York University. Rein became the long-term Director, until retirement in 2006, except for 2 periods when he was on a leave-of-absence from the University (1980 -1982; 1993 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1996.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRein conducted a series of Entrepreneurship Workshops in the Faculty of Science at the request of Keith Davey, the Dean of Science.  Most of the Workshop attendees were young scientists, who were either Post-doctoral Fellows or research assistants to established researchers. Many of these attendees were looking for opportunities to capitalize on their scientific knowledge or research. The established researchers were too focused on scientific findings that could be published in academic journals. Dean Davey wished to broaden their perspectives and the milieu in the Faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein, as Professor at The Faculty of Administrative Studies, raised funds from the Ontario government ($150,000) to start an innovation centre called Innovation York,  jointly with Faculty of Science. With the help of Dr. Davey, they convinced the University to give us the use of the first floor of the old Science Faculty Building, Farqhuarson Hall. It had excellent space for laboratories, ready for use by incoming researcher/entrepreneurs. We received permission to rent this laboratory space to entrepreneurs to start research based start-up companies.  A new science building was semi-finished, at the time, and was being built about $1,500,000 over-budget. Rein promised, with Dean Davey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support, to rent out the Farqhuarson laboratories space to pay off the Scince Faculty building deficit, which he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was founding Director and served on the Board of Innovation York, York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Innovation Centre, along with the Deans of Business and Science. He hired Richard Adair, a NRC consulting engineer to be the Director of The Centre. Adair was outstanding at mentoring nacent start-ups, something he had done for years. He had worked for the Innovation Centre at Waterloo University, the Canadian equivalent of The Massachussetts Institute of Technology, in Boston. It was a successful institution, well funded. Rein had lost out in a government grant competition to Waterloo couple of years previously. Stealing Richard was good compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver its 20 year life time, Innovation York launched 13 companies based on research conducted at the Faculty of Science and transformed a significant group of scientists, graduate students and Post Doctoral Fellows to become more market oriented. After 5 years, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests drifted away and Innovation York became part of the York University bureaucracy. Several years later it ceased to exist. Neither Dean Davey nor Rein were available to champion it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 14 Mari and Rein attended the TIMS Meetings in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Rein attended the Joint ORSA/TIMS Council Meetings and TIMS Council Meetings as the elected Councillor- International. As Programme Chairman for TIMS XXII, Rein met with the individual programme directors to make final arrangements for the programme in Kyoto, Japan, in 1975. After 3 straight boring days of meetings, Rein revolted and made arrangements to go sailing.\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard and Candy Welke, Sharon and George Wesolowski, Andrew Zendrovitz and wife (all from McMaster), and Rein and Mari went to the El Concistador port, to seek the boat that Rein had chartered. As we decended in a glassed-in, slope elevator, we wondered which of the many gorgeous yachts in the harbour below, we had chartered. When Rein asked the Wharfinger, he pointed to the bottom of the high dock wall, which minaturized a native, one-sailed wooden catboat . (Designer Fenwick Williams summarizes its original design philosophy as: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ample beam made the use of stone ballast feasible \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the high bow provided good support for the unstayed mast \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the barn door rudder provided adequate strength \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 high\\xc2\\xa0coamings\\xc2\\xa0served to keep water out of the large open cockpit). The boat was obviously built by and for local natives. The captain was a chubby short man with a significant belly, wearing cotton long pants, tied with a piece of rope, and no shirt. His crew was his 10 year old son who scampered around the boat like a monkey, following his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s orders. Some of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fellow passangers were on the verge of revolt, not believing that this would be a safe adventure.\\r\\nRein was able to convinve everyone to crawl on board. We sailed out of the man-made harbour, protected by breakwaters.  Breakwaters, also called bulkheads, reduced the intensity of wave action in inshore waters and thereby reduced coastal erosion and provided safe harbourage. An anchorage is only safe if ships anchored there are protected from the force of high winds and powerful waves by some large underwater barrier which they can shelter behind. \\r\\nMany stories were told and hilarity was enjoyed by all. George was christened by Rein as our ranking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderwater tank commander\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We sailed out of sight of land for a couple of hours. Our captain steered the boat with a large tillar clasped in his two muscle-bound arms, bare feet resting, spread-eagled on a deck that was awash. When we finally arrived at an idyllic looking island, both the captain and crew (neither could swim) put on lifesavers and jumped into the water and dragged the boat ashore. With ballast instead of a keel the flatbottomed catboat was ideal for such maneuvers. We spent the day collecting huge, beautiful shells, swimming and eating a picnic, then sleeping. This was definitely an improvement over listening to presentations of laborious academic papers at the conference.\\r\\nDr. William A. Dimma joined the Faculty in 1973 as a professor. He formerly was the President of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited and the President, Chief Executive Officer, and Deputy Chairman of Royal LePage Limited. Subsequently Dr. Dimma earned his doctorate from Harvard University and was the gold medallist of his class.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nWhen Dr. Dimma was appointed Dean, he asked Rein to become Associate Dean-Academic, which Rein declined. But Rein continued to play an advisory role as Chair of Faculty Council. \\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c11 brings us back to 2, me and you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.1974\\r\\n\\r\\n1975\\r\\nPol Pot\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Khmer Rouge\\xc2\\xa0take over\\xc2\\xa0Cambodia\\r\\nApollo from US\\xc2\\xa0and Soviet\\xc2\\xa0Soyuz\\xc2\\xa0spacecraft link-up in space\\r\\nJohn N.

March 5 Rein was appointed to  the Ontario LEAP Advisory Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 21, one day trip to Ottawa to make a presentation to representatives of the Treasury Board, about project evaluation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari and Rein went cross-country skiing, 10 km., with a stop for a picnic in the winter wonderland. Heaven!\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Ed were writing and rewriting chapters of the inventory book -- day and night. We couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe that, chapter 5 on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csimple\\xe2\\x80\\x9d E.O.Q. formula, took us 14 revisions, all of which were documented in Ed\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magnificient filing system.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalle Molder a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csister\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the Geislingen D.P. camp visited us. It brought a flood of memories from the past. Her mother Mrs. Lainurm kept an eye on little Rein (9 yrs. old in 1946) and made wonderful meals. Malle was the first girl that Rein considered a friend, in his life. Most of his life up to that point had been with males, during escaping from Estonia \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 although there were numerous female \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d everwhere, who were kind and helpful. Her picture, as a sexy marching cheerleader, graced Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school desks for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 1 Mari, baby Michael (3 years old), and Rein drove to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Mari was awarded her PhD on Schoellkopf Football Stadium field. Rein, sitting in the stands, failed to keep Michael awake until his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was called. This marked the end of our wonderful adventure in Ithaca, at Cornell. What an accomplishment, marked with the receipt of 2 PhD degrees from an Ivey League University. We, two refugees from Europe, and poor, struggling to raise our own funds, had been blessed by the dear Lord. No other explanation will do, to explain our good fortune. \\r\\n\\r\\nMari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievement was more worthy. She entered the B.Sc programme at Cornell with only a diploma from Sir George Williams College and was subjected to all sorts of tests which she mastered magnificently and was eventually admitted into the PhD programme without having completed a Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree. Cornell had a policy of not admitting  their own B.Sc.graduates to the PhD Programme. So we successfully applied for direct entry into the PhD programme with a B.Sc. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to have a policy that forbade this.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 5 Mari made a presentation at a Conference held at Seneca College and on June 13 to George Brown College. This became a regular event, as Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentations proved to be very insightful to audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 11 Rein gave a speech at The Federal Business Development seminar at Ryserson. His speech attacked the FBDB for providing consulting assistance, as well as providing equity and debt to Canadian small business owners who were in trouble. He pointed out that a government agency like FBDB, which he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFub-Dub\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, was in such cases, effectively, confiscating the owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s independence/ownership, just like was was underway in the Soviet Union. His speech became very controversial and was covered in the media. \\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone took up the label of calling the agency \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFub-Dub\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Relations between FBDB and Rein suffered for some 10 years. Eventually the agency/now a firm changed its name to the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDBC or BDC.ca). Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attack had no positive influence on policy. The FBDB eventually became \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe lender of last resort\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This satisfied the banks who were unwilling to lend money to such companies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVenture capital\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9clove funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, from family and especially from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrandmothers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, became more patently recognized in Canada. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa plus ca change, la plus c\\xe2\\x80\\x99est reste la meme chose!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandmother had financed Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business and she never let him forget that.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 15- 19 Rein and Dean Dimma travelled to Cincinatti for the ISEED Conference on Small Business. This, innocuous looking conference turned out be a life-changing moment in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. In particular, the presentation by Prof. Albert Shapiro on a model called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Entrepreneurial Event\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, increased Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to a career changing decision. Rein decided to leave management science, as an academic field, and was one of the first in the world to pursue academically \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which ultimately became the academic field of Entrepreneurship. He was allowed to transfer to the Policy/Strategic Management Area. Prof. Shapiro became Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentor and friend. He eventually recommended Rein, in 1985, for the prestigious Paul T. Babson Chair at Babson College, which he had held until his death, in Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartin K. Starr, spearheaded the solicitation of the papers for the Kyoto TIMS XXII conference (July 14 to July 28). Rein was responsible for managing the programmes at the Conference once the participants arrived at Kyoto. Some 5,000 persons showed up. It was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal that the TIMS XXII Conference would at least break-even. An important assumption, in our planning, was that attendees would only come so far to Japan, for tourism, rather than listen to their colleagues present papers, that they could read on their own. Extensive tours and sightseeing opportunities were set up. Papers of the presenters were made available to the people who did not attend any session.  Because these meetings were the first to be held in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmysterious orient\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, we had an unexpectedly large registration turn out, and the meetings earned a considerable surplus. This became the budget formula for future International TIMS Meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nArriving at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo with Mari, Rein went to the bar, while Mari rested. Rein had been considering becoming an expert in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJapanese Management Practices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was the de rigueur subject at the time in management academia. The Japanese auto industry firms were very dependent on small businesses as subcontractors. Japanese automobile companies had just successfully entered the American market and proved to be very tough competiton. At the bar he met an American management professor who said that he had married a Japanese woman five years ago, and now lived and worked in Tokyo. He was trying to become an expert in Japanese management. After 5 years he reported that he was just beginning to understand the Japanese culture. This was the end of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream of becoming an expert in Japanese management (quickly), he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to spend 5 years in Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon Rein had been invited to give a seminar on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCanada\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the\\r\\nDay-ici Kongyo Bank. About a dozen bank personnel attended. At the end of a 40 minute presentation, the bankers started to ask questions about Canada and its economy. Rein sweated buckets trying to answer very perceptive questions, most of them beyond his knowledge base. The questioners kept up a barrage of never ending questions. Rein noticed that the time had reached 1800. Surely these people had to catch commuter trains, etc. he said to himself. But the questions kept coming. Finally, somewhat exasperated, Rein remembered that Mari was probably getting worried about him back at the hotel. So, at about 1830, he slammed his hands down on the board room table and announced, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must go back to my hotel, my wife awaits, thank-you for your interest in Canada!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We immediately exchanged gifts and everyone cleared out of the room in a few minutes after that. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne junior person came back and said that he would show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Professor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d how to get out of the building. Rein had forgotten the advice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing is ever as it seems!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d given to him by his New York City secretary, who had extensive knowledge about the Japanese culture. As the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chonourable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lecturer, Professor, overseas visitor, it was his responsibility, culturally correct, to end a meeting. Oh well, live and learn, once again!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Programme Chair, Rein was expected to work closely with a local organizing committee of Japanese academics. It turned out, that they  assumed that they \\xe2\\x80\\x9chad the honour\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of running the meetings, while such distinguished attendees, from world-wide universities, were in Kyoto. Rein actually was responsible for everything, in Japan, and setting everything up with foreign paper writers and dealing with the TIMS organization. After a time of tug-of-war conflict, Rein decided to withdraw, and went on sightseeing tours in Japan/Kyoto like everyone else. When Rein returned towards the end of the Programme, the Japanese seemed to have managed the day-to-day affairs reasonably well and meticously. Except for a small group of German academics who complained that they had been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinsulted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the Japanese, who in their mind, should have, correctly, reported to Rein. Using money from the contingency budget, Rein took these gentlemen out to dinner and \\xe2\\x80\\x9capologized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on behalf of TIMS, and all was well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the Conference, attendance and presentations became sporatic. Rein decided to chair one vagrant workshop where the chair had not shown up. He knew that the participants knew their topic and the chair didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to know the content of the discussions. This resulted in a great amount of arousal among the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-appointed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Japanese programme organizers. After several confrontations, pulling rank on the Japanese, Rein continued. Half-way through the Workshop, a lowly looking Japanese fellow, approached the desk, where Rein was sitting, and handed a note to Rein. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may proceed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the message. Rein, subsequently, asked Mari to read a paper on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPapau New Guinea\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he chaired that session too, with no further interruptions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were getting pretty tired of eating food that was, at best, strange. So, we eventually, ran to a Westernized steak house that served Kobi Beef . Mari and Rein had tried to live in a Japanese style Ryokan Inn. Our room was perched on a ledge of a rocky cliff or mountain. With Tatami mats everywhere, Rein enjoyed bathing in the small, high-sided, wooden bath tub that you could sit in, on a stool. We also had access to a Japanese style bath, in the main house. To our surprise it was the size of a small swimming pool, with only us two in it, and it had attendants that made sure we enjoyed the experience. The pool walls were very ornate. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening a severe thunderstorm struck, with frequent lightening strikes that scared the heck out of us. We did not know how to close the wooden shutter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwindows\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Suddenly a very angry Japanese man ran into our room, grabbed a hooked wooden stick (from somewhere) and pulled the huge sliding wooden shutters shut. He was obviously displeased with our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstupidity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He implied that it was dangerous and that we could have ruined the delicate interior of the room. Stupid infidels!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also visited Niko and Nara and the deer park, where visitors bought food that could be handed out to the deer that struggled around you. If you did not feed the deer fast enough, they would bite your backside. Not something we had prepared for. Of course, we also visited many temples and shrines, including one that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t on the tour list, after Rein negotiated with a local priest. Beautiful gardens were everywhere and Mari and Rein later tried to  imitate such stone gardens back home on 14 Hilldowntree Rd. We were also taken to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d temples with squeaky floors (to protect against robbers) and one that the guide explained had burned down 2 years ago, but was officially still more than 500 years old. Oh well!?\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Takizawa, the ranking management scientist professor in Japan, sent, according to their social decorum custom, a delegation of 3 young professors, one of whom was a former student of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, to meet with him. It was late Friday afternoon and the return flight from Narita airport was to leave on Sunday afternoon for Toronto. The delegation had come to Kyoto to invite Rein, as a high ranking guest from outside Japan, to do Takizawa the honour of delivering an \\xe2\\x80\\x98Distinguished Public Lecture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at his University in Ohokayama. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Estonian cultural values immediately kicked in, that is, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us try and make it work!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The problem was that it was kind of late, and the next day was Saturday, and we were scheduled to fly back on Sunday. Was there anyone around on Saturdays and who would be interested, so soon after the TIMS Meetings, etc., etc. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6. ?\\r\\n\\r\\nRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former student, finally murmured, silently, without looking him in the eye, with his head bowed respectfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take our invitation so seriously!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At which time Rein recovered his bearings and declared, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am honoured by Dr. Takizawa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind invitation, but there is no way that I can give such a lecture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The delegation bowed, relieved, and rushed off to catch a late Shinkansen train back to Tokyo. Oh well, some lessons in foreign cultural customs, take a longer time to sink in. (Rein still has the slip of paper that constituted the invitation: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Kiyonori Kunisawa, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ohokayama, Meguru \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ku. Japan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day we took the Shinkansen (bullet train) back to Tokyo. We went to Narita to fly back to Toronto, where, relatively speaking, we knew the culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise York and the York Consulting Group MBA students started to consult with new ventures and smaller firms in Ontario, partly funded by the Ontario government. As Director, Rein was paid a stipend. The total revenue of YCG eventually totaled more than one million dollars (a hefty sum in 1975). Close to 20 students were working at YCG and a system of Senior (experienced) consultants and novice consultants was set up by Rein. A student Director, Kao, managed the everyday affairs and stayed in the job for some 4 years and then was hired by a consulting company. This turned out to be a tremendous learning experience for the MBA students, who received some hands-on work experience. Rein started a new MBA Course, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdvising Small Business\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, to help students and which was reguired from all novice consultants and was taught by Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a total of 12 days, between October 13 to December 10, Rein was under consulting contract to the CICA (Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants). Bob Veltheer, a former student, invited Rein to run the statistical grading control system for the final examinations of certicication for the CA (Chartered Accountant) at the Roehampton Place Hotel on Mt. Pleasant Road, North of Eglington. Prof. Al Rosen, also recommended Rein and supervised the examinations. Rein was responsible for controlling the grading consistency of each grader of the applicant examinations. If, through the period of the grading, a grader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s average started to vary from his cumulative grade average, Rein had to bring this to the attention of the Board, so that corrective action could be taken. Kenneth Paulus was hired to help with attending to the computer hardware. He had almost graduated from the Ryerson computer science programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nHughes Roy, from Moncton, was studying for his PhD, under Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervision. He had 3 lovely daughters. One day his wife came home with another woman and announced, before all 4 of them, that she was a Lesbian and in love with the woman. She wanted a divorce. Hughes and daughters were sent for a loop and Hughes eventually resigned from the PhD programme, after he had passed his Comprehensive Examinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 15 Rein attended the LEAP Review Board meeting. Mari submitted her research proposal to the Board of the Victoria Daycare Centre. At the time Mari and Rein were considering going into business for themselves, by opening a private daycare Centre. We eventually decided that it was not a financially viable proposition, although badly needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 23 -25 Mari participated in a Forum at George Brown College and Rein was responsible for Michael after 1700, each day.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 8 we visited the private Toronto French School, enquiring about admission and to learn about transportation. Mari eventually decided it would not work for Micheal. He would be picked up by car at 0600 and delivered back home around 1800. We obviously lived at the end of the route. This was too much for young Mike to suffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 25 Rein had his first meeting with James Conrad, the Director of Research for CFIB (Canadian Federation of Small Business). This eventually lead to Rein working under contract on research and eventually writing his book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business: Building a Balanced Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, using CFIB data.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 28, Bill Dimma retired as Dean and we remained friends for many years. He became Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most popular corporate director and often served as Chair of the Board of large, significant corporations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany evenings of great discussions and sauna \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 a delightful white Christmas \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eve fortunes and forecasts made by floating boats, and leaden shadows on the wall imagined by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Mari, 08.31.1975\\r\\n\\r\\n1976\\r\\nNadia Comaneci Given Seven Perfect Tens \\r\\nNorth and South Vietnam Join to Form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 5 Meeting at CFIB, to hear a presetation of research findings of the reputable Bolton Commission in the UK.  The following quote, from their Report, outlined Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future political mission and the theme of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best selling small business book in 1977: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 small firms are not inefficient in the use of resources. Their output per person employed is on the average lower than that for large companies, but this is in part explained by the labour-intensive nature of the trades in which small firms predominate, and by differences in the composition of the labour force \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the employment of more part-time labour, for example. It is also counter-balanced by a better return on capital employed \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\nSO THAT THERE IS NO GROUNDS FOR ASSERTING THAT AS A GROUP, LARGE FIRMS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN SMALL FIRMS IN THEIR USE OF TOTAL RESOURCES.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequent meetings at CFIB started, preparing presentations to various departments and committees of the Federal and Provincial Governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to be actively involved in supervising 10 MGMT 601 Projects per academic year. These projects were the equivalent of Masters theses that were done in groups 6 to 8 MBA students, who acted as consultants to companies and not-for-profit organizations. Rein was helped by two other professors who acted as specialist/content advisors. Over the 36 years on the Faculty, Rein supervised approximately 252 MGMT601 Projects (equivalent to Masters theses by the York University Graduate School). The MGMT 601 course was considered the most difficult and painful by the students. Graduates often recalled their time at the Faculty in terms of the painful group learning experiences they went through as MGMT 601groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to Chair Faculty Council and the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee was the last recourse in the Faculty for grade and behavioural appeals, and operated at times as a quasi-court with lawyers representing the University and student appellants. A denial of appeal could result in the expulsion of the student from the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein recalls two cases. A student, Demacio, was appealing his below required average grades, with his lawyer. He had telephoned Mari and made some threatening comments to her. Rein went looking for the student and grabbed him by his coat and said that he would beat the hell out of him if he telephoned Mari again. Fortunately, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pursue that tack again. The Executive Committee expelled him. A year or so later, Rein discovered that a Senate Committee had over-ruled our Executive Committee and Demacio was allowed to graduate. At the graduation ceremonies, in front of the whole convocation audience , Rein refused to place a graduate cape on his shoulders. Some students clapped in approval. A volunteer Faculty member, had to come up from the audience, and cape him. Several years later, Rein heard that Demacio was working at a large accounting firm, doing menial work as a data clerk. I guess he found his right level and everyone but Rein was satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second case involved a married woman in her fourties and her lawyer. She was appealing a grade of A- that she had received in a course. She had a convoluted argument. What Rein remembers from her logic is that it included the statement that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mother told me that I was very intelligent, and therefore I deserve an A+!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We declined her appeal (tittering).\\r\\n\\r\\nEric Winter, the Master of Calumet College at York approached Rein, as Director of Entrepreneurial Studies, to help them launch a not-for-credit course that helped students and the general public from around York University to launch small businesses. Rein delivered workshops and trained some of the Calumet (Arts) Faculty in how to advise start-up entrepreneurs. Calumet often called on help from either Rein or the MBA students working for the York Consulting Group. The Calumet students eventually got into book binding and related activities. A memorable project was carried out for the poor families living along the West side of the campus. The Calumet students rented a large truck and were able to buy or get donations for, a large quantity of canned goods that they sold at cut rate price, in large quantities, off the back of the truck in the poor neighbourhood. The Calumet students also helped a blind person to get into business for herself, using the telephone and her ability to knit.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was appointed Full Professor (Strategic management and Entrepreneurship).\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari flew to England, to London, for a vacation designed around visiting Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s childhood days in England. Mari was born on September 11, 1940. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother was living at the time in the Estonian Embassy on Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gate, near Hyde Park. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 11, 1940, coincidentally was the day that Hitler had planned to invade Britain. But, Hitler discovered that German forces were not ready for an invasion. RAF Bomber Command had been continually bombing ports from Calais to Boulogne and along the Dutch coast destroying many of the barges that were to be used by German army in \"Operation Sealion\", Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name for the invasion of Britain. Winston Churchill warned the English public, on radio that: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must regard the next week or so, as very important in British history. It ranks with the days when the Spanish Armada was approaching the English Channel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\xc2\\xa0Battle of Britain Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0is now the name given to the large-scale aerial battle that eventually took place four days later, on September 15, 1940. Mari and her mother spent time under the hospital bed, hopefully, thereby, protected from bombs and air raids. Babies born during this time period became known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlitz Babies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. All young children and babies were evacuated from London and Mari and mother were sent to Mountain Ash, Wales for the duration of The Battle of Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Mari became the pet of the Ambassador for Estonia, named Torma. After the World War II, England did not recognize the Soviet Government in Estonia and continued to recognize the Estonian Ambassadors in London and USA did the same in New York City. The UK government also paid the expenses for running the embassy, until 1991, when Estonia became Re-Independent. The last person, appointed by the Free Estonian government, as a representative, was still living fter the War, at the Estonian Embassy. She had originally been a maid. She was appointed as a Charges D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Affairs and represented Free Estonia at meetings of ambassadors and Consuls in London, until the new Estonian Ambassador, representing Re-Independent Estonia arrived in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also visited the Twickenham Grammar (Private) School which Mari had attended as a school girl. The school was still all there and brought warm memories back to Mari.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe visited other places of Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s youth, and then took the train to Edinburgh, Scotland. Mari had always dreamed of going to the medical school there. We toured the city and the proximity of the medical school. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein decided to seek out the tomb of Adam Smith, one of the earliest and most famous economists in his academic field. We searched among the tombstones, in an eerie and somewhat unkept cemetery, that was partly covered by a mist and it was raining lightly. Suddenly, from among the tombstones, emerged a deranged man, with a small scraggly dog. Mari and Rein at first were frightened, until it became clear that the deranged male was operating in his own head space, quite unaware of us. The tombstone, that we sought, turned out to be, inconspiciously embedded into the side of the church wall, and read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere Are Deposited The Remains of ADAM SMITH, Author of the\\r\\nTheory of Moral Sentiments And The Wealth of Nations.\\r\\nHe was born 5-th June 1723 And He died 17-th July 1790.\\r\\nKing James VII built Church 1637 Canongate Kirk.\\r\\nThe Kirk of Holyrood House And Edinburgh Castle.\\r\\nStag Sic Itur Ad Astra\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canongate is a district of Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. The name derives from the ... Sir Walter Scott writing in 1827 stated; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSic itur ad Astra (This is the path to heaven)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. ... recalling the old legend in which King David I was saved from goring from a\\xc2\\xa0stag\\xc2\\xa0by the sudden appearance of a holy cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Edinburgh we took the train to the Channel. The Chunnel/tunnel under the English Channel had not been built, as yet, and we crossed by ferry and took the train to Paris. On the ferry Rein bought a keepsake gold necklace for Mari. We stayed at a small pension on Rive Gauche. This clearly was a dream of Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (and probably most women in the world). We entered our room and were greeted by the television that was showing a pleasant ballet. We were shocked to discover, all of a sudden, that all ballet dancers were naked. Bienvenue a Paris extravigante! We ate most of our meals at a Pizzareia, which was more in keeping with our budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur one big expenditure was going to The Moulin Rouge for supper and their fabulous show. As a part of the dinner we were served a whole bottle of Champagne. At the next table were some rowdy Japanese businessmen, who eventually passed out and fell asleep with their heads on the table. Shy and usually timid Mari, spied two unopened bottles of Champagne on their table. To Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprise, she decided to liberate those for our own use. We left the Moulin Rouge, somewhat stealthily. Shy Rein and Parisienne Mari enjoyed free Campagne for the rest of their stay in La Belle Paris. We returned to Toronto, at the end of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 4 Rein delivered a post-lunch speech at the St. Lawrence Centre for the annual meeting of the Association of Canadian Insurance Agents. The large theatre had a steep set of stairs going straight to the last seats that were very high up. A drunk attendee started to hassle Rein, during his speech, by shouting out loud, such things as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, that is not true!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me tell you how it really is!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Others in the theatre were trying to shut him up. Rein was used to such persons from previous speeches. So, Rein engaged in a repartee with him, to the hilarity of the audience present. Eventually the drunk keeled over and started to roll down the stairs, until someone stopped him. He was carried out by some security men. The speech was recognized by the person, who hired Rein, as an excellent entertainment and Rein was asked to come again, next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 7 at the time 1930 Mari continued to deliver a course on CJRT Radio called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrowing Persons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The course was recognized by Ryerson as a credit course. Rein was expected to listen and provide feedback. She did such a good job it was difficult to provide helpful criticism and to stay awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 19 Michael was home from 0900 to 1100 and April 27, 28 Mari was teaching in the evening on Thursday nights. Rein was baysitting often. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was my son too\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 29 Rein made a presentation to the Progressive Conservatives at Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Park. Rein continued to advise and to do research at CFIB.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 9-12 Rein flew to Washington, D.C. to help CFIB meetings with NFIB and to make a presentation to a Senate Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 17 Rein appeared on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCanada AM\\xe2\\x80\\x9d CFTO television programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20 Rein flew to Ottawa and made a presentation on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsensus: Small Firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein met with classmate Peter Kirkham, Chief Statitician Canada, and politicians, including some people from Joe Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. We were trying to convince the Prime Minister to name a Minister of Small Business, which he did at the next cabinet shuffle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 25 Budget night for Federal Government. John Bulloch was answering telephone calls from the media. Rein, Jim Conrad and others were feeding John with one-line \\xe2\\x80\\x9cZingers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to get coverage in the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 26 Rein delivered speech to the Association of Canadian Publishers about small business economics. David Godfrey, who would become the publisher of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first book, wanted to influence the debate at the Association and Rein was asked to serve on their advisory committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 22 As a part of  volunteer work for the government funding agency, LEAP, Rein attended the meeting of N-Tec, in Port Robinson (near Welland). Cost-Benefit Analysis was being carried out. N-Tec helped mentally disabled individuals to learn job skills and thereby hopefully eventually integrate back into society.\\r\\n\\r\\nN-Tec was founded in 1970 by John Brennan, who had a vision for his son, Jimmy, and others like him who were perceived as being unemployable because of their mental, physical and/or emotional limitations. N-TEC had blossomed into a unique agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf-way through the meeting, a mentally deficient participant burst into the room with an axe in his hand. He threatened to harm someone. It was not clear whom he was seeking. Doug Clark, the Director of N-Tec, calmly told the axe-holder to calm down and to put the axe down. He apparently had experience with the fellow before. He continued to converse firmly with the obviously confused and agitated man, who eventually lowered the axe and ran from the room. Doug Clark continued with our meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 28 Rein was interviewed on CJRT. Rein and Ed continued to work on their inventory book \\xe2\\x80\\x93 revisions after revisions were being debated and made.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 7 Rein met Jim Conrad, Director of Research at CFIB. He was getting a bit bored with the amount of time the Inventory book was taking (5 years had passed). Rein discussed with Conrad, the possibility of writing a small business book, using CFIB data and research that would compete with E.F. Schumacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world best seller, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business is Beautiful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein felt that small business was more important, economically, than Schumacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book had made clear. He wanted to write a book called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business: Building a Balanced Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein met with John Bulloch and said to him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are an evangelist without a Bible! I am on my sabbatical, and I will write you a Bible, if, you make available to me all the data at CFIB and if you allow me to speak to everyone in your organization. I want you also to commit buying a copy of my book for all your 50,000 members. I will spend my sabbatical at CFIB working for you and my book, free.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bulloch was a bit caught off guard, but agreed with one proviso. CFIB Vice-President Shero would have to read the book and approve of it, before CFIB bought a copy for each member. We agreed and we shook our hands on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 25 Rein went to Kingston establish his sailing qualifications and passed his Intermediate Skipper examinations. He was now officially qualified to skipper a sailboat, anywhere within the sight of land. He did this now with increased self-confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 August 1Rein and Mari observed the Olympics in Kingston and Montreal and then drove to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandmother home in Seabrook, New Jersey. She was a difficult woman to visit. But she (along with Uncle Daniel) had during the War years shepparded Rein through difficult times when Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father was not available. Grandmother had a tendency to act like a staff-seargent and command people around her. She never really accepted Romulus as husband to her daughter Amanda and harassed him about the money she had lent him to start his business. While in her home, in Seabrook, she tested both Mari and Rein in various ways to gather information for her personal needs. For example, Rein recalls waking up around 0700 one morning to discover grandmother offering two small glasses of vodka under Mari and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s noses. It is still not clear, why Grandmother would do this, except that she was testing to see if we were alcoholics. We slept on the living room couch, and were under constant observation. Nevertheless, Rein felt thankful for all she had done for him during the War years. We tried to visit her periodically, but, it was never enough or pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 17, 25 Rein appeared on Global TV on Chris Pochmursky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s popular Global Events programme. Rein continued to help CFIB with lobbying, whenever given the chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 25 Rein flew to Europe to attend academic conferences and to take advantage of opportunities to promote entrepreneurship and small business. He arrived in Switzerland (Zurich \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Merlingen, Sept. 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Oct. 1)). Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentation was well received, except for a mishap that was caused by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poor use of the German language. A rather pompous German academic, who clearly considered himself better than the rest of us, presented a rather disjointed paper. He was from the Folkwang University in Essen. Rein thought he knew that Essen was in the Ruhr valley, once the industrial heartland of Germany. Rein was prompted to ask in his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d German, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVo ist das Hesse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Meaning to say, exactly where is Hesse? In the industrial district?  But it sounded to the speaker as an insult (i.e. nobody had ever heard of his academic university in Hesse). He proceeded to praise his university and the importance of the Ruhr area, etc. for 45 minutes, with the chair of the session trying to quiet him down. Rein was of course seen by other German speakers as the culprit. Finally the room was emptied by people walking out, including Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded around 845 and historically linked for centuries to the old\\xc2\\xa0Krupp\\xc2\\xa0family iron works, Essen was one of Germany\\'s most important coal and steel centres until the 1970s and attracted workers from all over the country. Essen was home to 13 of the 100 largest German corporations and the seat to several of the region\\'s authorities. Ninety per cent of Essen was destroyed by Allied bombing in an attempt to retard Germany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s War production. The one \\xe2\\x80\\x9crenowned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d educational institution in Essen was apparently the Folkwang University, founded in 1927. Google does not rank the university highly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Merlinger, Rein discovered that while Switzerland had a reputation as an independent, peaceful country, it was heavily militarized. On the trains it was not unlikely to see young people with machine guns, travelling presumably on reguired military duty. In the morning squadrons of fighter airplanes boomed their way down the Merlingen Valley, directly in front of the famous Zermat Mountain, of skiing fame. Rein was told that apparently many of the surrounding mountains were extensively excavated and tunneled and filled with military equipment and personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 2, 3 Rein subsequently visited Lausanne and Geneva to meet with Philip Neck of the International Labour Organization, who was interested in getting access to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research, which he subsequently republished in an I.L.O. Book. Rein also visited with several former students.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 4, 5 Rein next visited Vienna and delivered lectures at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Rein had been invited by Professors Nanjundan, Pichler and Hruska. \"WU\" was the largest University focusing on business and economics in Europe and, in terms of student body, one of the largest universities in Austria. It was ranked as one of the best business schools in Europe. In 1976, it was still dominated by theoretical economists, who had little interest/understanding of business. Rein was helping his friends who needed help to sell the importance of entrepreneurship and small business in academic research.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 6, 7 Rein visited Aarhus, in Juland, Denmark to give a series of lectures on entrepreneurship. Two persons (whose names are lost in memory) were trying to increase the teaching of small business and entrepreneurship. In 1976 the current Department of Business Administration was primarily an Institute of Technology, with an emphasis on food technology. Rein visited Aarhus several times more in subsequent years. One of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PhD students, Peder Christienssen, was from Aarhus and is now a Senior Economic Analyst in Brussels at The European Commission. The\\xc2\\xa0European Commission\\xc2\\xa0is the\\xc2\\xa0executive\\xc2\\xa0body of the\\xc2\\xa0European Union\\xc2\\xa0responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the\\xc2\\xa0Union\\'s treaties\\xc2\\xa0and day-to-day running of the EU. Peder had become a close family friend and we continued to exchange visits periodically.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 8,9,10 Rein lectured at the Copenhagen Business School.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 11, 12 Rein made a presentation at a seminar in Uppsala University at the reguest of Professor Dick Ramstrom, the ranking university professor of business in Sweden.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 13, 14 Rein lectured at Stockholm School of Business. Prof. Gustafsson was interested in labour market organization. Rein also met with Anita Ekstrand, Tore Kjallquist, Aberg and Carl Holm. All this had been arranged by Dick Ramstrom, who was a very genteel fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 15, 16 Rein met with Dezso Horvath at the University of Umea and at his home. Horvath had missed coming to the 1975 TIMS meetings in Kyoto and Rein had tried to track him down for his seminar presentation. In the process Rein had picked up a Horvath curriculum vitae and was impressed, as were his colleagues, back at the York Business School. But, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s colleagues didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that we could attract an academic of such standing to our Faculty. Rein promised/bet that he could go to Umea and convince Horvath to come to York. \\r\\n\\r\\nHorvaths were very hospitable and Rein stayed at their home for 2 days. On a Saturday evening it was customary among Swedish/Hungarian/Estonian families to go to sauna. Rein took the opportunity to make a pitch in the sauna about the advantages of the Horvaths coming to Toronto and of  Dezso joining the Faculty of Administrative Studies. Initially, there was some resistence. But when Dezso went out of the sauna to get some more beer, Mona, Dezso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife, asked Rein whether she could find a job as a Chief Accountant in Toronto. Rein promised/guaranteed that this was possible. Rein was sure that Professor Al. Rosen, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend and well-known accountant, would help Rein to deliver on his promise. This became eventually true.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein asked Mona about how we could convince Dezso to come to Toronto. She replied that if Rein would offer a two-year visiting appointment, then she would do the rest. Later, next day, Deszo accepted a two-year visiting appointment. This was subsequently turned into a tenure track appointment and eventually Dezso was elected Dean in 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 17-18 Rein visited colleagues, Gorb and Beesley, at the London Graduate School of Business. Rein tried to meet with Bannock to discuss his research on small business. He was busy so Rein went by train to Manchester and met with Bannoch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s colleague, David Watkins, at the Manchester Business School and returned to London by the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day Rein visited Parnell House in London and a Mr. Winter of the Institute of Intermediate Technology. The Institute had been set up by Dr. Ernst Friedrich \"Fritz\" Schumacher, the author of the most popular economics book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Is Beautiful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d published by Sphere Books Ltd. in 1973. Schumacher was born in Germany and died 1977 in Switzerland. Rein wondered whether there was any way his own planned book with CFIB could be sponsored by the Institute. Mr. Winter provided Rein with some interesting research material and said he would mention it to Schumacher.\\r\\nE. F. Schumacher was greatly influenced by\\xc2\\xa0Mahatma Gandhi\\xc2\\xa0and his concepts of an economy of permanence and appropriate technology. Schumacher described Gandhi as the greatest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople\\'s Economist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, whose economic thinking was compatible with spirituality as opposed to materialism.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSchumacher had been a student of Maynard Keynes, whose theories implied that bigger is better. Schumaker differed substancially with the famous economist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theories by the end of his life. Schumacher wrote on economics for London\\'s\\xc2\\xa0The Times\\xc2\\xa0and became one of the paper\\'s chief\\xc2\\xa0editorial writers. This made his name known to many readers.\\r\\nAppropriate technology\\xc2\\xa0was an ideological movement, originally articulated as\\xc2\\xa0intermediate technology\\xc2\\xa0by the economist\\xc2\\xa0Schumacher. It was generally recognized as encompassing technological choice and application that was small-scale,\\xc2\\xa0decentralized,\\xc2\\xa0labor-intensive, energy-efficient,\\xc2\\xa0environmentally sound, and locally controlled. \\r\\n\\r\\nAppropriate technology was commonly discussed in its relationship to economic development. Appropriate technology was an alternative to the transfer of\\xc2\\xa0large firm, capital-intensive technology, from\\xc2\\xa0industrialized nations to developing countries that did not need it, nor could afford it. \\r\\nBecause only large-scale technology was being manufactured, smaller economically viable firms, could not match appropriate technology to their real needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Schumacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death in 1977, George McRobie carried on their joint work by writing a practical guide book called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Is Possible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, published by Harper and Row in 1981. This book made prominent mention of the work of Prince Edward Island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Institute of Man and Resources, an organization which first drew McRobie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention to alternative technology research in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 22 Train to Sheffield to meet Geoff Wood and on to Durham to spend time doing lectures for Prof. Gibb, discussing research and Small Business/entrepreneurship lobbying. When being shown the Durham Cathedral, an older local gentleman in the know, apologized that parts of the cathedral \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere only a thousand years old\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the airplane back to Canada, Rein picked up a copy of The Economist and read an article by Norman Macrae, an editor of the publication. He proclaimed the coming of Entrepreneurial Revolution saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c1. The world is probably drawing to the end of the era of big business corporations \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c2. Big businesses will not be replaced by state capitalism, because state production of services and goods has not worked well \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c3. Successful large corporations of the future will devolve into \\xe2\\x80\\x98confederations of entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c4. The next generation of whiz kids will be those who make big business grow efficiently smaller by selling off bits of the corporation \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was hooked! The trip home seemed to last no time at all, as an excited Rein made notes for his first book, on small business, to be published before the inventory theory book with Ed Silver was to appear next year, in 1977. The decision was firm.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 1 Rein met with Dr. Sinclair, at his laboratory and factory in Vaughn, North of Toronto. He showed Rein a handful of marbles in his hand and said that it was his goal to release the energy trapped in them by fusion. This energy would be sufficient to provide energy for North America. His convincing arguments were eye-opening. Unfortunately this scientific dream was not to be realized in his life time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 1, 2 Rein met with Bob Grasely to learn about venture capital, an industry that was just getting off the ground in Canada. Grasely had an extensive financial, experiential background. Rein hired him as a part time professor in the Entrepreneurial Studies Programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 10 Rein presented an outline of his proposed book to Jim Conrad and John Bulloch at CFIB.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 15 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Rein was in Washington, D.C. at the International Symposium of Small Business. With John Bulloch he met with Mr. Motley of the National Federation of Independent Business, the much larger lobby organization for small business in the USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 5 Mari as the Founding Director of the Ryerson Infant Day Care and Education Centre, held an open house where Rein was introduced to her staff. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution to Ryerson was huge and she never got the deserved credit. She built a very viable institution, as well as a respected teaching facility for the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 7, 8 Leon Danco was in town running executive development sessions for family businesses. He had the most extensive family business consultancy in the USA. He was interested in expanding his business to Canada and asked whether Rein would be interested in becoming a partner in such a venture. Rein asked for time to think about it. He decided that he would miss the stimulation of research and his colleagues. Danco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business offer was lucrative and all consuming, financially.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 24 Our traditional Christmas dinner that Mari prepared when a neighbor showed up, unexpectedly, in a santa suit. We could see him coming up the path through our living room window. Michael was shocked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh my goodness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fortunately, Michael had been a good boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA beautiful Christmas and New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eve with Kenn. Santa paid an unexpected personal visit! We never found out who it was \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Mari, Dec. 31, 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\n1977 \\r\\n\\r\\n*    Elvis Found Dead                                                                                                       *    South African Anti-Apartheid Leader Steve Biko Tortured to Death \\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 4 Rein met with David Godfrey, who owned the publishing company, Press Porcepic. He was also a famous writer. His novel\\xc2\\xa0The New Ancestors\\xc2\\xa0won the\\xc2\\xa0Governor General\\'s Award for English language fiction\\xc2\\xa0in 1970 and a second Governor General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gold medal for the best poetry book called Top Soil, a book of patriotic poems. We discussed Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upcoming book and he said he was interested and would help edit and publish the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 11 Rein delivered a dinner speech to an Association of Jewellers at Royal York Hotel. Question was what the hell to say to a bunch of jewellers? They got the usual speech about the contribution of small busiess to the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan.13 Rein wrote a letter to Vice-President Farr, opting out of any unionization of York Faculty. There had been a formal meeting with members of the Labout Relations Board of Canada. After a series of presentations, the chair asked whether anyone in the room objected to the formation of a union. Rein stood up and declared his opposition. The Board was made up of lawyers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is the lawyer representing you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein was asked.  No one was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho will defend your interventions?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein responded , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI presume that it will be you, your Honour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis meant that there was going to be a campaign on the campus between the group arguing for unionization and the group that Rein helped to form called The Independent Faculty Members. There were many members of York faculty who wanted to support the Independent Faculty Members. But it was unclear which group had the majority. All the silliness of academics was subsequently displayed. One Arts faculty member, thought that this was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to him and he wanted to write a book about it. The leadership of the No Group (Rein had rejected the position) was very ineffective and the opposition group had outside union groups helping them. In the subsequent campus-wide vote the Yes group won a 60% majority. The Labour Relations Board declared York University unionized. But at Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention  joining the union was not to be mandatory.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 18 and 20 Rein was lobbying with CFIB at Ontario Legislature, Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Park. PC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s McKeough, Handleman, Bennet, Jones and Ismail met with us about Small Business Policy suggestions. We also met with Liberal and NDP research officers. Eventually we met the big wigs in the Liberal Party, Stuart Smith and David Peterson both of whom were subsequently elected as Premiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 25 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Feb.4 Rein was working, as Reimar Associates, on a big consulting report for N-TEC. After volunteering with LEAP for many years, Rein was asked to do an evaluation of the programmes and achievements at N-TEC. On Feb. 7 Rein presented the report to the Board of N-TEC at Port Robinson. On Feb. 16 Rein presented the report to the LEAP Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2 Rein flew to Montreal and subsequently travelled to Mt. Tremblant for meetings with CIDA (The Canadian International Development Agency). Rein became acquainted with the people involved, their policies and reguirements for projects. CIDA would over the next 20 years grant York University approximately 16 million dollars, for 2 large international aid projects in Russia (after the collapse of the Soviet Union), lead by Rein partly through Reimar Associates Inc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in Montreal, Rein visited the Brace Institute.\\xc2\\xa0The Brace Centre for Water Resources Management accomplished its mission through the following activities: research and development of new technologies and systems that could be used to enhance the quality of life. For example, policy and strategic studies to enhance the sustainability of institutions and the water sector in general.The development of projects with partners in Canada and around the world for integrated watershed management, and water quality measurements and modeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, Romulus, had identified the St. Lawrence River watershed as a major possible location for an epidemic, as a result of drinking water pollution. The Montreal Island, Isle Jesus, had on its shores a series of little towns. Each town would draw its drinking water, upstream and would dispel its sewer water downstream. Downstream, of course, would be another town drawing its drinking water upstream, etc. There was no overall coordination by an integrated watershed management strategy or Agency. Romulus was convinced that this situation would need to be fixed. For that reason he had urged Rein to specialize in municipal engineering at McGill. In Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion, Rein would have employment for a long time on Isle Jesus. That is, in part, how Rein ended up in Civil Engineering at McGill.This and other interventions indicated to Rein, the very smart thinking by Romulus, who had only grade 6 education, back in Estonia. Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do any projects with Brace Institute, but his father was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 13 Mari spent the week-end working at CJRT. Michael and Rein were batchelors at home. On March 17, 22, 29 and April 5, 12, 19, 26 evenings Mari was broadcasting her CJRT course and Rein was again looking after Michael. Each CJRT show was 90 minutes long. It involved a lecture prepared by Mari, followed by Mari answering on-air, telephone calls from new mothers and old. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the day, when Mari was working as Director, of the Ryerson Centre, Michael was placed at the university daycare centre. He had long 10 hour days. Mari eventually decided that was too much and that she should resign from her job. What finally precipitated the leaving had to do with her battle with Ryerson senior administration. During winter the old house that constituted the Center developed huge dangerous looking icicles hanging from the roof. They were big enough to do serious damage to a person who happened to walk under a falling icicle. The bigger danger was the possibility of an icicle hitting a child. Mari and Rein agreed that she should resign if no action was taken. The whole issue came to a head, when administration refused to give funding to the Center for a 2 to 1 ratio of children/babies per adult. Some \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d acre administration person suggested that an adult could carry three children during a fire alarm, by putting each child under their two arms and then somehow wedge the third child between them. That did it. Mari resigned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar. 23 Rein went to Ottawa for the day to a meeting with The National Headquarters of LEAP. He made a presentation on his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNext Best Alternative Model\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for project evaluation, as a part of the existing procedures used by LEAP. His approach was accepted and he trained some Ontario LEAP personnel on it on April 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral editorial meetings during this period ocurred with David Godfrey on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business: Building a Balanced Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d book.\\r\\n\\r\\n May 13 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 14 Rein chaired a Forum at Ryerson on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUniversity Involvement in Stimulating Small Business: Growth and New Venture formation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Attendees were from small business university student consulting programmes. Rein had started such a programme for the Ontario Government. Rein was interviewed on TV about the programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 26, 29, 30 Rein spent full days editing with Godfrey, Chapters 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10, with some of the chapters revised 2 or 3 times. The presentation and structure of the book changed 100%.\\r\\nJune 11 and 12 Rein spent at Godfrey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s farm in Erin, Ontario. Because of the impending deadlines, we had to work for two days with Rein standing behind the tractor while David was plowing his field. Despite the distractions we got a lot of creative work done. I guess, one could say our attentions were focussed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 13 - 14 We went to the Booksellers Association Meetings. David Godfrey was unsuccessful in finding distributors who would be willing to sell the small business book through their channels. It seemed that David had had some conflict with some of the distributors in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 15 Ray Sherk of CFIB read the small business book\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final draft to decide whether CFIB would buy a copy of the book for each of its members. He approved the purchase of the book for each of the 50,000 CFIB members (at a significant discount).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book Small Business: Building A Balanced Economy, eventually became an international best seller, selling 130,000 copies. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business mailed one copy of the book to every elected politician in Canada, thereby buying 7,000 more copies. This created a significant demand for the book in Canada and the world market. Rein was invited to give speeches on the book June 23 and 25 and for two years after in several parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 27, 28 Rein gave a speech to The Ontario Advisory Council of Engineering at the Guild Inn in Scarborough.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was invited to co-lead World Bank mission to Indonesia (5 months) to recommend changes that would improve their venture capital industry and civil service delivery system of entrepreneurial assistance to the Putribuma (the native peoples of Indonesia). \\r\\n\\r\\nNew course was launched : \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrategy Study of Entrepreneurial Firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (MGMT 6100), equivalent of a Masters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Thesis. Previously the course had been limited to larger companies only. Throughout 1977 Rein supervised 9 York Small Business Assistance Programme student consultants advising firms in Canada. This reguired editing/ approval of all final reports and the approval of all new consulting contracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 6 Rein met with Ben Wicks, a world famous cartoonist, who drew 10 cartoons, one for each chapter of the book. Some people joked later saying that people bought the book because they enjoyed the professional cartoons, only.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 10 Rein, Mari, Michael and Scruffy went to the Mara shore Lake Simcoe shore property they had bought. It was beautiful and located next to the village of Riverside on the East side of the Lake Simcoe, some 90 minutes from the house in Toronto. We discovered that the property reguired Rein to go up North and cut the grass every 2 weeks. The neighbours were building mansions with 3 car garages and wanted to build sidewalks in front of their houses. Our \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccountry cottage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dream disintegrated and we sold the property. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCivilization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Toronto was spreading too fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 13 Rein delivered the pasteup of the book to printers and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComing Soon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Posters to book stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 15 Rein flew to Ottawa for the day to make 3 presentations on, Appropriate Technology, Conserver Society and Incentives for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to some senior ITC bureaucrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 2, 3, 4 Rein was writing Reimar Associates report to ITC (Industry, Trade and Commerce) on the granting of Job Tax Credits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sept. 4 On Vacation, we (Mari, Mike, Grandma, Scruffy and Rein) rented a Recreational Vechicle for a trip across Canada to Victoria, B.C. to see the first copies of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business: Building a Balanced Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d book. David Godfrey had moved to Victoria. The trip passed through Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Banff, Jasper, Vancouver, Victoria and back to Toronto via The Trans-Canada Highway. At every stop grandmother was off the vehicle first and immediately would start a bonfire.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 8 Rein met with Dr. Smith, the Liberal Premier of Ontario and his staff, at Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Park offices of the Premier.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 16 Meetings were held with civil servants from the Small Business Secretariat, from Ottawa, at CFIB.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 19-30 Start of Book tour in Ottawa with CJOH TV. Followed by Radio \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHot Line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interviews, telephone interviews, TV tapings, in Halifax, St.John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, many interviews in Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct 4-6 Rein appeared about his book on Hamilton CHCH-TV, CBC-TV Mid-Canada AM, and Omnesia inToronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 19-21 Rein made a presentation to the Science Council Meetings in Ottawa, and regarging the need for a Small Business Act at Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Park, Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 22 Rein delivered a speech on \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmall Business\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Ontario Federation of Labour Forum for Full Employment. It was the rowdiest crowd that Rein had ever addressed. Speaker after speaker was damning the governments, whether Provincial or Federal. When it came for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Peterson\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to speak there was a rapt silence and then boos. Caught up in the electric aura of the meeting, Rein shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business stands for Full Employment! Long live the Ontario Federation of Labour!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A scream went through the crowd. The crowd totally captured Rein, he had never felt such emotion on the stage, before or after. Somewhat dazed Rein delivered the usual slogans about the merits of small business for the Canadian economy and escaped off the stage, behind some welcome curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 27 Rein gave another presentation in front of the Science Council, this time in Toronto. In the afternoon Mari and Rein drove to Madoc, Ontario in Eastern Ontario. Mari presented a speech to an audience on her book and Rein in another room gave a speech on his book, which was followed by a panel. Clearly the panel covered the spectrum of Canadian politics: PC, Liberal and NDP.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 31 Rein had a meeting with Leo LeGrove, CEO of Roynat. These meetings eventually resulted in a consulting assignment for Reimar on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Role of Interest Rates on Small Busines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research concluded that small business was more concerned about a quick access to funds rather than fractions of a per cent in interest rates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This message was implemented in Roynat policies and also in some other Canadaian financial institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov.10 Rein appeared on the Saturday Night CBC-TV show and was interviewed by Sandra Gwynn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 14 Rein gave speech to the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineers on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndustrial Strategy and Competition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Holiday Inn on Dixon Road by the Airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 22, 23 Rein met in Halifax and St.John, N.B. with civil servants who were preparing provincial economic strategy proposals for their Legislatures.\\r\\nDuring this period, Rein continued to consult with CFIB, 5 to 10 hours a week. \\r\\n\\r\\nDec, 19 Rein flew to Montreal to accompany David Godfrey for meetings at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, St.James Club and HEC Business School of the Universite de Montreal. Supper was with Godfrey and Prof. D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Aniello, who translated the book into French and it became a best seller in French. Rein became very popular in Quebec as a result. Unfortunately all the proceeds from the French edition were absconded by either Godfrey, D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Aniello or the Quebec publisher. C\\xe2\\x80\\x99est la Vie!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the tradition in the Peterson household to set a Christmas Eve Dinner with one extra empty plate for Jesus or any stranger who might drop in, unexpectantly. Dan and Marian Horigan, not knowing that we celebrate Christmas Eve this way, dropped in unexpectantly and were welcomed to our dinner. They were of the Swedeborg (New) Christian tradition. Emanuel Swedenborg\\xc2\\xa0(1688\\xe2\\x80\\x931772) claimed to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ through continuous heavenly visions which he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years. In his writings, he predicted that God would replace the traditional Christian Church, establishing a \\'New Church\\', which would worship God in one person: Jesus Christ.\\xc2\\xa0The church apparently encourages visits to friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 houses, Christmas Eve.

Most of these people actually came from other communist \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepublics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d like Kazakstan, Kyrgistan, Afganistan, etc. They found Estonia very strange and unfamiliar. As did Estoinians who met them and found major cultural differences, but had to work with them. These intruders were told by Moscow that they were superior chosen \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoviets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and therefore had a right to work anywhere in the Soviet Union. The Soviet intruders tended to lord themselves over Estonian workers, refused to work properly, and were often absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 4-6 Rein at meetings in Ottawa, Canadian Construction Association, lectured on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTechnological Innovation Studies Programme at York\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and to ITC, on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResearch on Consortia and large-small firm Joint Ventures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and the same to Canada Export Association. Rein had written a research paper on the topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 14 Presentation was made to Science Council on behalf of CFIB, at The Guild Inn. The topic was the importance of small business to individuals in Canada and the World in general. It was still a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHippie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d time in Canada. Throughout Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lecture a bearded young man/boy, was playing a fife, while he sat in the corner of the room, perhaps trying to create a mileu of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeace and calm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (without disturbing the audience). No one had invited him, it seemed that he just came to the Guild Inn venue, on his own. A remnant of the 1960s, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHippies\\xe2\\x80\\x9dwho  rejected middle class values, opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War. They embraced aspects of Eastern Philosophy and sought to find new meaning in North American life. Hippies were often vegetarian and believed in eco-friendly environmental practices. Rein noticed a slight smell of Pot smoking, while speaking. This was familiar from living at Cornell and Columbia Universities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 barely more than boys and girls who decided to try something different... we laughed at them. We condemned them ... we hated them for their flowers, for their love, and for their unmistakable rejection of every hideous, mistaken compromise that we had made throughout our hollow, money-bitten, frightened, adult lives.\"\\xc2\\xa0 --- June Jordan, from the 1960s.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many times must the cannonballs fly, before they\\'re forever banned?

Rein made a research presentation at academic conference and had a short vacation.\\r\\nFeb. 10 -12 Rein was working on Inventory Book, intensively.\\r\\nMar. 21- 23 Rein lectured at University of Manitoba, Winnipeg and flew to London, Ontario, to deliver lecture to the Western Business Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nMar. 30-31 Rein was at meetings with ITC in Ottawa.\\r\\nApril 13- 15 Rein lectured at UPEI, Charlottetown, PEI.\\r\\nApril 16 Rein was elected a Fellow of Calumet College.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 25 Meeting with Jacob Levitsky in Washington, D.C., Rein was invited to join a special World Bank Mission to Indonesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 8 Rein was invited to join the Board of Governors of Junior Achievement of Canada by Ed Miskiman, CEO.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early May, Decision Systems for InventoryManagement and Prodution Planning (1979) was finally published, after 7 years of painful rewriting and writing. Rein was the first author, after flipping a coin with Ed Silver. Rein won. The book was published by John Wiley & Sons, the foremost publisher for management science books. For the second edition (1985), Ed Silver was first author, as we had agreed, and the book title and publisher remained the same. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the third edition, Inventory Management and Production Planning and Schedulimg (1998), will again be with Wiley, Ed Silver would the first author and David F. Pyke was the second author and Rein was bumped to third. For the fourth edition, Wiley no longer believed in our book. If there is found a new publisher, then Rein will get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdistinguished former author\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recognition. Ed and David were worried about getting a new publisher, but the biggest challenge turned out to be the rewriting of the book, given the rapid changes in the field of mathematical inventory theory, and the demand for a theoretical book like ours seemed to decline with computer based applications and the like.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf there was a fourth edition (with tongue in cheek) Rein would be lucky if they acknowledged Rein as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDistinguished Former Author Emeritus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 progress in practice, awaits for no one. It had been a wonderful ride, but other interests and age have become dominant. It brings to mind James K. A. Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow (Not) To Be Secular\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Secural Age is prevalent today, in that all we learned to be Holy, yesterday, is being replaced today by new realities, such as social media. We are trapped in a terrain mapped out by the likes of Albert Camus, whose significant contribution to philosophy was the idea of the absurd. Do you recall the story of the Myth of Sisyphus? Rein was proud of the long and hard work that went into the First Edition. But most of the kudos for the first edition will always be deserved by Ed Silver. He devoted his life to the theory; it was a meaningful contribution to Optimization Theory. \\r\\n\\r\\nJune 2 - 12 Rein and Mari flew to Cape Breton. They were based at Sydney and toured the island while Rein gave lectured on his small business book, as requested by the local economic development agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 25 Rein and Bob Grasley, whom Rein recruited, (a venture cpital specialist) flew to Washington, D.C. for briefing by The World Bank, so as to be ready for an Indonesia Mission. June 21 we flew via San Francisco to Hong Kong (to become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacclimatized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and then on June 25 we arrived in Djakarta. In Djakarta we were billeted at the 5-star Hotel Borobudur and met with an array of Indonesian bureaucrats, lead by our assigned mission leader Jakob Levitsky. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first meetings was with an Indonesian  General, who apparently was in charge of welcoming of aid groups like us. The small man he sat at the end of a looong board room table and we were asked to sit at the far end. It soon became clear that we were not overly welcome. The General shouted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSooo \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 which one of the many groups, that have come here to help us, are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Levitsky, a veteran of these missions, responded that our mission was to help the only Indonesian venture capital bank, P.T. Bahana and to help the Putribuma (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Sons of the Soil,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the indigenous Indonesian people) start or participate in entrepreneurial ventures. The General understood better what we were doing there, than Rein. We were apparently there to put together a World Bank loan proposal for, at least, some 30 million US dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlying over to Indonesia, Rein was full of idealistic ideas about helping the poor Putribuma. Rein remembers well the blast of hot air that hit him in the face as he dismounted the steps of the Garuda airplane, after a long journey from a World Bank Washington pep talk. What could he do to help more than 200 million poor people, living on more than 5,000 islands, who were still recovering from colonization by the Dutch and invasion by the Japanese during the Second World War?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story, that day, in the local English version of a newspaper was about the 50,000 Chinese middlemen who had been butchered by recent rioters. Chinese, as is the case in most of Asia, were clearly the entrepreneurs who filled in the cracks between the large multinational and Indonesian government company that served markets. Many of the recently massacered Chinese were automobile dealers. Rein became less sanguine about his idealistic view of this mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of us consultants was assigned by The World Bank a driver and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccounterpart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s driver was called Mercedes (he drove an Australian Ford) and his counterpart/bodyguard was Adrie, a recent university graduate and one of the few Indonesian Presbyterians, in a country that was 86% Muslim, 6% Protestant, 3% Catholic 3% other. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day off,  in the afternoon, as we were enjoying some drinks at the bar, when Rein was asked what he had done with his driver. Rein replied that he had done nothing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat means that he is outside still waiting for you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you are supposed to officially dismiss him for the night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Indeed, Mercedes arrived with the car, when paged on the public address system; he had spent the night sleeping in his car in the parking lot. Rein gave him 4000 Rupiah from his pochet. Mercedes thanked Rein profusely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny time you want me to sleep in the car and wait for you, let me know, Sir!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Back at the bar I was told that 4000 Rupiah would be close to a week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pay for Mercedes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein called Mari long distance in Toronto. Mari was a bit agitated, because she had been left in charge of the extension, for a large 17ft. by 17 ft. family room being built onto the back of the garage and next to the kitchen. One of Rein students had drawn the architectural plans, but forgotten to allow for the breezeway between the house and the garage. Rein spoke to the general foreman and suggested how he should deal with this oversight and everything eventually went well. The Italian construction crew would not take money \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and therefore our payment plan went askew. Rein told Mari not to worry about it. If they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to take any money, from you, they will have to wait until Rein (a male) got home. That was how the construction issues were resolved successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Grasley went to a series of meetings at B.T. Bahana (an Indonesian government owned venture capital firm). The complaint was that in the last 4 years, since its opening, they had placed only one small equity investment. We discovered a group of persons, totally unqualified and scared, to take risk on any potential venture capital investments into Butrabumi firms (who tended to be poor peasants). We spent several weeks trying to train them and trying to revise their overly cumbersome procedures. It became clear that you cannot make a risk-taking venture capitalist out of Indonesian culture-bound bureaucrat/civil servant, whose very life and their family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life depended on the money paid as wages. A job in the army or as a government employee was the actual ultimate goal of everyone. Other work alternatives were associated with fishing or farming or as labourers on construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 28 Rein met with some bureaucrats who wanted his advice regarding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstitutes of Food Technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  As it turned out these institutes had been set up several years ago to determine \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthrough research\\xe2\\x80\\x9d how to best produce and market Ju-jube fruit. (According to Google: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp until the past decade, the jujube fruit has been quite misunderstood \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a case of mistaken identity in its first introduction, if you will. Slowly, the true nature of this exotic fruit, its benefits and uses are coming to light outside of the jujube fruit\\'s Chinese origins\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein and some hosting bureaucrats arrived at these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstitutes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, it became quickly clear that no research had been done for 4 years and no one seemed to have any ideas as to how to market Ju-jube juice. Upon tasting some samples, the berries tasted awful. There seemed to be a lot of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresearchers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d wondering around the halls in white coats \\xe2\\x80\\x9clooking busy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We flew to a total of 4 Institutes, then one of the bureaucrats admitted that the Institutes were known to be ineffective and had been forgotten and left \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto work on their own\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, without supervision and direction from headquarters in Djakarta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same Government Agency, then asked Rein to evaluate and make suggestions on the internship programme for young university graduates, who were sent to help village Chiefs as personal assistants. Rein visited, over 4 days, villages where Chiefs had received interns. It became evident that the Chiefs had received interns, without asking for them, and without instructions as to what to do with them. For their part the university graduates/interns were mostly city or town boys and knew very little of village self-sufficiency style of life. What worried the students, the most, was that they felt abandoned, with little contact with other interns or anybody who could advise them how they could eventually escape from their village life job assignment.\\r\\nRein decided that village Chiefs needed help, for example in marketing the village\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products or getting assistance from government assistance programs. But the interns had no training in business or management. He therefore recommended that each of the interns be given a Kawasaki motorcycle, so they could visit each other, and network (this actually happened, eventually). \\r\\n\\r\\nHe also recommended that all of the Ju-Jube research institutes, but one, be closed (this recommendation was accepted). There seemed to be no need for all the duplication and incompetence among the various so-called berry \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresearchers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Hopefully by attrition the best ones could be weeded out (if corruption could be limited). He also recommended that several of the former Institutes be converted into training interns and other university graduates headed for the government bureaucracy or to help village chiefs. Most Indonesian universities produced graduates primarily with Bachelors in Political Science, Arts and general science. Rein also recommended a career ladder for all interns and other trainees that lead to eventual promotion to a full time \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctenured government job\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for life. Most of such positions were achieved, at the time, by either paying large sums of graft money to those in a position to hire or through political appointment. Rein hoped that some portion of his recommendations, backed by World Bank money and influence, would be eventually implemented and that turned out to be the case, from feedback, several decades later.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack at Hotel Borobudur, we (all the consultants) drew straws and Rein won the short straw and he was therefore assigned to assignments in the most desirable, Bali end, of the Java Island. On July 7 Rein asked Mercedes and Adrie whether they would be willing to drive Rein, on July 8, to Surabaya, rather than take an airplane. They reluctantly agreed. According to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calculations it was785.8\\xc2\\xa0km via \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJl, or Nasional 1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d along a paved highway: Jakarta \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Parmanukan -- Semarang \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Surabaya (that is, along the shorter North Shore road). The highway turned out to be indeed paved, but only about 1.5 automobiles wide. When meeting another vehicle, each driver had to put the wheels on the right side of the automobile on the gravelly shoulder and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhip\\xe2\\x80\\x9d past an oncoming vehicle. Only problem always was that the shoulders (and the main road) were filled by throngs of  pedestrians on foot, hauling unbelievable loads on their heads. Mercedes had to, each time, sound his horn loud and long, and hope, that the heavily laden pedestrians could scatter out of the way. Very nerve racking for Mercedes on the wheel and less so for unaware Rein and Adrie on the back seat.\\r\\nHeroically, Mercedes agreed to turn South at Semarand to see the temples near Jogjakarta, also called Borobudur. Evidence suggests that Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and abandoned following the 14th-century decline of\\xc2\\xa0Hindu\\xc2\\xa0kingdoms in Java and the\\xc2\\xa0Javanese\\xc2\\xa0conversion to Islam. Borobudur has been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the\\xc2\\xa0Indonesian government\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0UNESCO, following which the monument was listed as a UNESCO\\xc2\\xa0World Heritage Site. It is the largest and most magnificent Hindu temple in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were in Jogjakarta we were taken to see Ramayana and Kamayoran. We also saw an outdoor show using \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShadow Puppets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that told many of the folk and religious tales that were clearly important and known to the Javanese audience. The audience sat enraptured watching the puppets and shouting encouragement at times for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood guys\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and shouting threats and boos for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbad guys\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The shadow puppets were made out of leather and painted appropriately to reflect the traditions involved. Rein recalls that the number one hero seemed to be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing of the White Monkeys\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe eventually arrived, exhausted, in Surabaya late on July 9 and were welcomed at an old Dutch colonial house by a relative of the original Dutch colonial owner. He had agreed to help us on our World Bank mission. Mercedes approached Rein, and asked for permission \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto check himself into a hospital\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He said he was going to have a nervous breakdown. Mercedes request was of course granted, by a shaken Rein, who had not understood the terrific psychological pressure Mercedes had been under. Adrie explained that the gymnastics of avoiding pedestrians over 800 kms. of 1.5 lanes wide highway, for 2 days, had lead Mercedes to a breaking point. If he had hit someone and hurt them seriously, the crowd would have attached Rein as the responsible person in the back seat. They might have killed Rein. Mercedes would have lost his good job and the 17 persons in his immediate family would face starvation. He was the only one of their extended family with a good paying job.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia, with a magnificent history. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Surabaya was a sultanate and a major political and military power in eastern Java. The expanding\\xc2\\xa0Dutch East Indies Companies\\xc2\\xa0took the city over from a weakened Sultanate in November, 1743. Japan occupied the city in 1942, as part of the\\xc2\\xa0occupation of Indonesia, and it was bombed by the\\xc2\\xa0Allies\\xc2\\xa0in 1944. After that it was\\xc2\\xa0seized by young Indonesian nationalists, lead by Sukarno.                                        \\r\\nThe architecture of Surbaya was very European, Dutch red clay roofs were evident, interspersed with Indonesian and Surabayan styles. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch colonists had had every intention to live there forever and the number of 3-rd and 4th generation colonials, who had been born in Indonesia was evident.We were to be the guests of a 4-th generation colonial, whose family still controlled some Indonesian firms. The house was filled with antiques and servants. Our host had returned to Surabaya recently from Holland. He immediately took it upon himself to explain to us how much he loved and respected the native Indonesian people. While he said this, very dark black, almost invisible servants, silently slithered past us on their heels or knees on serving errands. We were served cocktails by a servant who somehow moved around on his heels, bent over and holding the tray over his head so that we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see his face. This apparition is burned into Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind and the sound of the host\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrogant words still echo in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ears. Our host was clearly still behaving like the Lord of a colonial manor from the Dutch past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the unreal apparitions continued when Rein went to a primitive men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, and in the darkness discovered, he was not alone. There stood a very black, tall skinny man holding a mop and pail, apparently waiting for Rein to complete his transaction. At the end of it he handed Rein a warm rag to wipe his posteriror. It was scary and humiliating, at least to Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the next few days we were introduced to a number of notables, but no business with the World Bank was evident. On the afternoon of the second day we were sitting and having tea in a room that looked like the office of a University Chachellor. Suddenly Rein was escorted to a door, behind which sat an auditorium of some 1,000 students. Herr, Doctor, Professor, Rein Peterson was introduced to the crowd as the Convocation speaker. Television cameras were rolled into place to capture every word Rein was going to say. Caught off guard, Rein asked himself what speech, what talk, had been planned for him to make? Stairing at the silent crowd of eager looking eyes and the whirring of the cameras, Rein tried to compose himself in his mind. The only language that made any sense would be English, and without notes, he had no choice but to give one of his barnburning salespitches for the value of Entrepreneurship to individuals in Indonesia. At the conclusion of his rant, Rein received a very warm and loud cheer! His World Bank colleagues were able to watch the speech on television in Jakarta. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the hell was that all about, they teased Rein?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He had assumed he was somehow at a university.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his speech episode, Rein continued his mission onto the nearby large island of Madura.The classic way to get to Madura involved taking a decrepit public ferry from Tanjung Perak, north of Surabaya, to the end of the North road on which which we were to travel by Jeep.The sea crossing from East Java to the island of Madura took about an hour. Measuring about 160 km in length and about 40 across at its widest point, Madura supports a population of close to 3 million inhabitants, who mostly are farmers or fisherman. The Island had been historically divided into 4 Regencies, each headed by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Some sort of royal authority was still being recognized, along with an entourage of chiefs and nobles of the people and poor peasant farmers. \\r\\n \\r\\nHistory had not dealt the people of Madura a kind card. The island had been in an almost perpetual state of conflict with the different kingdoms on and off the island. In the colonial period the rulers of the east and west Madura were often allied with the Dutch and, whoin return for protection, provided natural resources and troops. In World War II the pugnacious Madurese suffered enormously under the Japanese.In December 1949, in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence. Madurans played a significant role in this conflict too.\\r\\n\\r\\n In 1978, around 4 million eked out a living from subsistence agriculture, corn, tobacco and cloves, salt panning, lime kilns, fishing and cattle farming. A larger contrast to the largely lush and fertile\\xc2\\xa0Java\\xc2\\xa0next door was hard to imagine. There seemed to be an effort under way to start a lime industry. Madura is well known for its Batik Textile products and Rein bought a Batik wall-hanging for Reet Sarap to eventually give to her in Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, it was a Maduran custom for Rein to meet with all 4 chiefs, each representing their respective former Regencies. This all was by the way of a prelude to the negotiations with Rein as to what they needed from the World Bank. At each Rengency, Rein met with a representative or Chief for tea, accordingly, as was their custom.  Most of their formal ceremonial places seemed to be outside in lavish Chieftan quarters. By the third Regency Rein felt stuffed with pastries and a large amount of tea. Rein asked for directions to the bathroom from Adrie. The mammoth, well fed, big chief suddenly pointed toward a door, across his courtyard. Rein was not sure whether he had caught sight of the right door. He opened the door and was faced with a large white tile floor and what looked like a bathtub filled with warm water. But nothing that looked like a Western toilet. With nature urging for quick relief, Rein was forced to lower his trousers and leave a gift in the middle of the white tile floor. WHAT SHOULD HE DO NOW !?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed no evident depository. Thank the Lord, that Rein was a civil engineer, he finally decided that the deposit must travel downstream. So with the scoop from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbath tub\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein chased his deposit downstream, which turned out to end up at the gap under the front door. Through a crack in the wall, Rein could see Adrie in conversation with the Chief, who seemed to be waving his hands as if urging us to move on. Rein quickly exited and shook hands with the Chief, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go quickly Mercedes!!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reaching the fourth and final Regency, Adrie turned the Jeep around and we headed back towards our starting point. Once again we stopped at each Chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s domicile and quickly passed through number 3, with less ceremony, and blessedly without incident.To this day, Rein has in his memory a scene of the Chief talking to his colleagues, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe World Bank fellow was nice enough, except he crapped on my \\xe2\\x80\\x9cxxx\\xe2\\x80\\x9d floor, what boors these Americans are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBack, at the start of our Madura Island journey, large soft chairs that could adorn an elegant living room, were set up in two half circles. Under the chairs and the spaces in between, were covered with Perian rugs that looked expensive. Rein was shown to a chair, Adrie sat to the left and apparently another translator sat right next to and to the left of Adrie. Facing us, seated, were mammoth gentlemen in all their finerly and what looked like turbans. These were not the Chiefs we had visited and apparently they might outrank them, when it came to decision-making. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdrie introduced Rein as a World Bank consultant and the chap next to him retranslated for the rest of the crowd. The obvious leader of the Madurese higherachy welcome Rein, was translated for Adrie who passed the words on to Rein in English. It all seemed like the old parlor game, but Rein kept his cool and decorum.\\r\\nBack and forth we went with Rein trying to determine what kind of a development programme would be of interest to them. Slowly, but emotionally, Rein discovered that the gentlemen wanted money to buy trucks to haul the island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salt and lime to Surabaya. Trucks driven by evidently Chinese middlemen were visible to us, heading towards the ferry and Surabaya. Obviously a strategic location had been chosen for our  meeting. Rein agreed to recommend the purchase of such trucks. He turned toward the Madurese leader/spokesman and asked, pointedly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat are you going to do with the Chinese middlemen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Madurese gentlemen flushed and sat closer to Rein, then clenched his fist towards Rein and said, in perfect Oxfordian English, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeave that to us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His meaning was very clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Surabaya, Rein experienced a ride in the front \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbasket\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a three-wheel bicycle taxi. As he sat there, the driver weaved through unruly traffic, with no apparent rules to a Westener, it occurred to Rein that if the driver made a mistake, it would be Rein who would take the brunt of it, sitting up front. But a greater hell came about during our visit to Surabaya. The Indonesian government wanted to make use of their recent oil discoveries. So, suddenly, they decided to ban the bicycle taxis and every driver was sold/given a small Datsun pick-up truck. A few obvious steps had been skipped, like teaching bicycle drivers how to drive a truck. Nor was the gasoline properly refined and it produced a black cloud from the exhaust. Luckily we escaped to Denpasar, Bali.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Denpasar we stayed at the 5-star, plush, Bali Beach Hotel, each of us was given a beach house. Life was like in paradise, it became obvious why everyone had envied Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s straw-draw result. Our first call was to the village of Mas, the gallery/workshop of Ida Bagus Tilem, whose dead father Nyana, was worshipped by all Balinese carvers as the greatest originator of Balinese mythical wood art. Ida Bagus Tilem, son of famed woodcarver Ida Bagus Njana, was also legendary, and widely regarded as among the best wood sculptors of all time.When Rein approached Ida Bagus, he asked him as to who he was (meaning what was his name). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the embodiment of Balinese art and a teacher of future persons who will carry on our culture forever!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein was caught off guard, he was only there to meet him, and to see how the World Bank might help him with his mission. It turned out that Ida Bagus Tilem was exactly who he said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t being arrogant. He was worshipped as a Demi-God. Ida Bagus Tilem furthered Nyana innovations both in his working of the wood and in his choice of themes. Unlike the sculptors from the previous generations, he was daring enough to alter the proportions of the characters depicted in his carvings. He allowed the natural deformations in the wood to guide the form of his carving,\\r\\nTilem took up \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabstract\\xe2\\x80\\x9d themes with philosophical or psychological content: using distorted pieces of wood that were supposedly endowed with strong expressive powers.\\xc2\\xa0Ida Bagus Tilem, however, was not only an artist, but also a teacher. He trained dozens of young sculptors, from the area around the village of Mas. He taught them how to select wood for its expressive power, and how to establish dialogue between wood and Man. \\r\\nAs he showed Rein around the amazingly beautiful building, young carvers were evident everywhere. Unexpectently, he observed one carver, and gave him a violent kick on his side. The boy fell over and very few short words were exchanged, unexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTourists who came to Mas in the past were the wealthy Dutch and willing to pay the price of my masterpieces. Today, we get busloads of clerks and secretaries who can only afford the work of only my less experienced students. This has a major impact on my business. I do have some art distributors that resell some of my better pieces of art, in New York City, in London, and elsewhere, but this is not enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRein promised him to try and help him find some more distributors for his art in the USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdrie next chose for us a route to travel inland toward some high hills, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmountains\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, in the north. This was known as an area of more radical Hindus and Adrie clearly showed some nervousness. Two things became apparent about Adrie. If we stopped at some artisan shop he would quickly check into what seemed to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmotel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, to catch a few winks of sleep. Rein first noted a bump under his shirt at the waistline. He was obviously, and had been always carrying a gun. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counterpart turned out to be his bodyguard.  Adrie, was a bodyguard who needed more sleep than an apprehensive Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy July 7 we were back in Djakarta and Rein joined a meeting with Levitsky, Banford, Grasley and a new consultant. Returning to Hotel Borobudur it became clear that the group had decided that, to pay for his cushy visit to Bali, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next assignment should be to a wilder location \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ujung Pandang, known to English speaking folk as Makassar.\\r\\nOn July 8, before departing for Ujung Pandang/Makassar, Rein gave a lecture to a University of Indonesia seminar, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeveloping Entrepreneurship among Individuals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Prof. Dr. Janedi Dju and the Dean Dr. Nasrudin were in attendance, with the intention of including entrepreneurial studies in their curriculum.\\r\\n\\r\\nMakassar was the provincial island capital of South Sulawesi, a big island east of the sparsely populated island of Kalimatan. It started to become an important trading port beginning in the early sixteenth century as part of the kingdom of Gowa. The Kings who ruled Gowa were strong believers in free trade, which proved a hindrance to the Dutch plans to monopolize the spice trade. The Dutch sponsored a revolt by some of the other kingdoms under Gowa\\'s rule, and eventually forced a treaty which allowed them to effectively occupy Makassar in 1667. The people of South Sulawesi remained staunchly independent, and resistance to the Dutch rule continued into the 1930s. There also has been some resistance to central Indonesian rule, from Djakarta.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the communist victories in neighbouring Indo-China in 1975, Thailand received the brunt of refugees from Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos. The Vietnamese, in particular, have never been held in high regard in Thailand and little sympathy for them remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMakassar has long been the base for pirate boats that for centuries have raided the commerce in the Straights of Malacca and Signapore. Kalimantan, Sumatra, Papua and Nusa Tenggara islands were dominated by the Bugis people, who were well known as reliable shipbuilders and have always been feared as pirates. Vietnamese refugees\\xc2\\xa0fled\\xc2\\xa0Vietnam\\xc2\\xa0by boat and ship after the\\xc2\\xa0Vietnam War, especially during 1978 and 1979, continuing until the early 1980s. Boatloads of Vietnamese refugees tried escaping in panic, in not seaworthy boats, from the Communists, and became a bonanza, for rape pillage and robbery by the piates. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn international anti-piracy programme was begun finally in 1988. But Thai and Bugis pirates still exacted a savage toll on refugee boats from Vietnam, sailing through the waters of the Gulf of Thailand. The eventual reduction of the problem in the Malacca and Singapore Straits was partly related to the increased efforts by individual states to combat piracy. But in large measure it was the result of the recognition that piracy is an international and trans-boundary problem that can only be tackled effectively by cooperation between the littoral states.\\r\\nRein went to the Ujung Pandang harbour and discovered large, majestically painted, coulourful, multi-masted large wooden sailing boats, docked parallel, with their bows tied up to the dock. This was an impressive and daunting sight which was never again matched during Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subsequent sailing career. Adrie informed Rein that some of these were still active pirate ships and we should keep clear of the area. Our mission was to meet with filigree silver jewelery artisans dotted around Makassar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art of creating filigree jewlery consisted of curling, twisting and plaiting fine pliable threads of silver metal, and uniting them at their points of contact with each other, by means of\\xc2\\xa0flux\\xc2\\xa0such as\\xc2\\xa0borax, with the help of a\\xc2\\xa0hot blowpipe. When granulated motifs are desired, small beads were made traditionally by using precious stones, metal wire or fine sheet, which were cut up in small pieces and mixed with\\xc2\\xa0the flux. Small grains or beads of the same metals are often set in the eyes of volutes, on the junctions, or at intervals at which they will set off the wirework effectively. The more delicate work was generally protected bya framework of stouter wire. Such artisanship reguired excellent eyesight and a steady hand with a lot of patience. Most artisans followed patterns and motifs that have been handed down through the family, for generations.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein recalls one visit to a family of artisans. They lived just outside Ujung Pandang, along a gravel road, that lead to a copse of very old trees. The home of the artisans consisted of a very large circular structure that was somehow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwound\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around a huge tree trunk. Off the ground, the tree house, was entered up a sturdy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cladder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The structure on the inside was one large round room with 360 degree surrounding windows providing intense light, to artisan work stations. The middle of the room was curtained off and apparently contained the kitchen and private change rooms. A gaggle of teen-age girls were tittering behind the curtains and they would cautiously peek out at the visitors periodically. Each girl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face was decorated with white paint designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elderly father of the family sat us down at a table and some ladies served us tea and biscuits. It was explained to us that a Chinese middle man visited them monthly with a roll of pliable silver thread and cut a piece off and weighed it. He would then pay them so much per measure of silver thread used bythe artisans during each month. The artisans would not get paid for the artistry and designs that went into each intricate, beautiful, jewellery piece copied from ancient family heirlooms. We all agreed that that was not fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were next given a tour of the workstations to admire the artistry. At some stations were seated very young children, some perhaps as young as six years old. Apparently they had the physical capability to make very intricate work, because thay had good eyesight and a steady hand. At other stations were seated older, grizzled persons who were supposed to check the authenticity of the designs and they would correct any faults in the workmanship.\\r\\nThe World Bank had received complaints that these artisans were using \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforced\\xe2\\x80\\x9d child labour. We asked the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfather\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about this. He replied and said that the children see this almost as play time. Furthermore, they would work only as long as they felt like it every day. They were clearly very proud of their contribution to the family coffers.\\r\\nRein concluded that this was not a malicious child labour practice. Similar family practices seemed to be common in South Sulawesi Island. He reported this in his report to the World Bank and recommended that more careful consideration to be used by inspectors who were not allowing for local, non-Western, cultural practices used by locals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 16 we returned to Hotel Borobudur in Djakarta. A debriefing meeting was held by Levitsky and each consultant reported what they had concluded and found. We were instructed to prepare precises of what we had found and what we would be like to recommend to The World Bank in Washington, D.C. as to investments.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 19 we started a review of each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposals.  Rein was instructed to increase the dollar value of his proposal by at least two times. Apparently the World Bank wanted to lend more money than his carefully considered proposals. The government of Indonesia was given these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdevelopment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d loans and was expected to repay them to the Bank in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 22 Rein flew to Manila and gave a series of lectures on entrepreneurship at the Institute for Small Scale Enterprises (ISCE). Manila was a tense city with streets full of young hoods apparently looking for trouble. Using the rising wave of lawlessness and the threat of Communist insurgency as justification, Martial Law was declared 1972 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1981. In 1981 Ferdinand E.Marcos was reelected, in the midst of accusations of of electoral fraud. He ruled by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties and closed down the Congress and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists. Crime rates plunged dramatically after a curfew was implemented, but eventually excesses by the military emerged and the support of the general public declined and protestations started by activists, were encouraged by the general public.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was transported to ISCE for his lectures in a private car through streets that were almost empty. All the University faculty members seemed to be female, nervous and intent on pleasing the visitor from abroad. In the hotel, military personel were guarding the front door with machine guns and on each floor there was an armed guard facing the elevator door as it opened. Rein decided to go for a swim in the pool that was partially inside the hotel and partially outside, behind high walls. This caused a panic with bells and horns sounding all over and military men came running and \\xe2\\x80\\x9crescued\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein from the pool, reprimanding him, that, the open pool was unsafe and could be fired upon by snipers.u\\r\\nRino, Jr. and Senator \\r\\nRein did enjoy an evening of Jai-Lai competition in a large building that was separated into two. The upper part of the stadium was protected by bars and wire from the lower part, which was filled with rabid, screaming, skuffeling working class people, who obviously understood the game better than Rein. We were transported back to the hotel under guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 25 Rein flew to New Delhi, India. He was asked to visit with officials from various bureaucratic agencies that had many questions about the importance of small business, entrepreneurship and public policy. The government offices looked like something left over from British colonial times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cXerox copies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were made by passing a sheet of paper through a machine which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmagnetised\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, whatever had been put on paper. Then in a crude container, the magnetized papers were shuffled through what looked like very fine iron filings. The finished sheet of paper, after a long, labour intensive procedure, looked like a normal sheet of  Xeroxed paper we are accustomed to in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile waiting for the procedures to be completed, Rein wondered outside, to the corner of the street. Suddenly women dressed in rags, looking dirty, appeared, each with a container that contained food. This apparently, Rein was told was a daily ritual luncheon meeting by local very poor women from the caste \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuntouchables\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. They were clearly having a good time sitting partly on the sidewalk and on the road. Rein next flew to Mumbai (formerly Bombay).\\r\\n\\r\\nRein took a taxi, late one evening, and the driver said that it was absolutely necessary for him to visit the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaxi Park\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We arrived in total darkness in a parking lot filled with perhaps some 200 taxi cabs. In the back, on passanger seats were drivers, sleeping. Apparently most of the drivers slept only for a few hours each day, between multiple shifts of work. Some apparently didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a proper home at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had planned to fly to Nairobi, Kenya by Kenyan Airlines. He had agreed to meet some former students and to give some lectures. When he arrived at the airline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counter and asked for his boarding card, the man behind the counter said he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for the Airline. When Rein pointed to the sign hanging from his desk that clearly said Kenyan Airlines, the man grabbed the sign and ran down the long hallway and disappeared. Rein wandered around trying to figure out what to do. He eventually heard a clear public announcement that Kenyan Airlines was ready to depart for Nairobi.\\r\\nAnother Western passanger advised Rein that probably his seat had been sold to someone for more money illegally. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein decided then to fly to London and then to Washington, D.C. to report on his findings. He approached the British Airlines desk and was told that there were no seats until tomorrow and that he had to come back early in the morning. Rein made friends with another passanger in the same fix. He was a retired baker from England who also hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to get back home by British Airlines. He had tried to bribe some of the airline employees, to no avail. He said he had not slept for 3 days. He had spent all his retirement funds to visit India, because he had spent time there as a soldier.Rein also spent two days trying to bribe himself onto a flight. The person at the airline would every time say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put your name first on the waiting list!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It became evident that other bribers, who followed, would out-bid Rein and their names would be put on top of Rein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con top of the top of the waiting list.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was also clear that obviously rich big families of Arabs, men, women young and old, all in expensive flowing robes were being escorted to several of the flights Rein was trying to get on.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein bought a biographical book on Mahatma Ghandi at the bookstore and spent his time reading about Ghandi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life in Bombay. Eventually he took taxis to visit the places described in the book. The most memorable place Rein visited was a renowned site on the shore of the Arabian Sea.\\r\\nOn 12 March 1930, Mahatma Gandhi embarked on a pilgrimage with 79 followers along the\\xc2\\xa0Arabian Sea\\xc2\\xa0coast. This march, known as the\\xc2\\xa0Dandi March, was sensationalized by the international press. Video clippings and pictures of Mahatma Gandhi were relayed to distant corners of the world. Gandhi reached Dandi on 6 April 1930. After his morning\\xc2\\xa0Bhajan,\\xc2\\xa0a Hindu\\xc2\\xa0devotional song, expressing love for the\\xc2\\xa0Divine,\\xc2\\xa0he waded into the sea shore and picked up a handful of salt, proclaiming that with this handful of salt he was proclaiming the end of the British Empire monopoly on salt in India. The British had burdened the Indians, for years, with a heavy tax for salt. This was the start of the eventual founding of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest independent, self-governing, democracy, called India.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the airport, unexpectedly, we were approached by a Captain of British Airways, curiously his name tag said he was called, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaharaja\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He said that he had been observing us two having trouble with the airways and offered his help. That afternoon at 1600 we were on a British Airways flight to England. My retired baker/friend was deliriously happy. We slept all the way to London, where we parted. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein stopped at British Pub for a big mug of Bitter and a visit to the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room. He then slept all the way to the Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C.  We arrived in the afternoon of July 29.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was billeted by the World Bank at the beautifully restored Georgetown Inn, in the master suite on the top floor, with an open pool on the roof. Mari arrived on July 31, in our Toyota Corona from Toronto, after a tiring journey of 12 plus hours, along with Grandmother and little Michael. It was a fun reunion after being apart for all this time. Mari and Grandmother and Mike toured the restored village of Georgetown, along the small canal. There were many antique shops that displayed trophies that Mari and Rein wished to acquire. We ended buying a beautiful mellow patina, ancient workman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tool chest, which travelled back to Toronto in the front passanger seat, while everyone else was packed tightly on the back seat. Crazy !\\r\\n\\r\\nEach day, Rein was working on his final report, with recommended action and loan amounts, on Indonesian projects, he had discovered, for action by the World Bank. We arrived back in Toronto on August 7, in time for teaching classes on day after Labour Day, September 5.\\r\\nAugust 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20 We visited with the Tonis and Kadri Laar family at their Foote Lake cottage. We had decided to sell our own cottage property on East side of Lake Simcoe. The Laars had owned their cottage for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgust 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 23 Rein was hired to chair the general meetings of The Solar Energy Society at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada. This probably was the beginning of the Canadian solar energy industry. At the time, Rein recalls, that the best application of solar energy technology was to to provide heating for a water heater tank in a private house. As the Moderator of an Expert public meeting on Solar Energy, Rein co-ordinated a myriad of unrealistic propositions that were put forth. The meeting involved 300 to 400 fanatical people, in an arena, without the guidance of Roberts Rules of Order. Rein found it very difficult to maintain order. He tried to suggest that the consensus of the panel was that solar energy was suitable only for local applications, like the waterheater, and not for transmission of electricity via hightension wires. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moderating conclusion was not accepted. Rein still believes that he was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 11 Rein delivered a lecture at Union Carbide head offices in Toronto about his trip to Indonesia and his belief that a balanced economy has a closely knit network of small and large businesses and firms that export. It was Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 38-th birthday, which was properly celebrated that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 28 Rein flew to Ottawa for the day to give a lecture on a Balanced Economy and Small and Large Enterprises to the Small Business Development Group of the Industry, Trade and Commerce Ministry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 11, 19 Rein met with Leo LeGrove, President of RoyNat that wanted Rein to write a presentation, based on his research, to be entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo Interests Matter to Small Business?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein ultimately argued, based on his research that small businesses were more interested in quick access to funds, when they needed it, than wanting to haggle about the exact amount interest charged by RoyNat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 18 Rein flew to Montreal for the day to investigate why a French edition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business: Building a Balanced Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been printed in Quebec in French as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPetites et Moyenne Entreprises Pour Une Economie Equilibree par Rein Peterson\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It turned out that two professors at the Universite de Quebec a Montreal, Paul Dell\\xe2\\x80\\x99Agniello et Raymond Normandin had prepared an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadaptation francaise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the publisher, Le Cercle du Livre de France, Montreal. Quebec. This was clearly a violation of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s copyright. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter discussions with David Godfrey in Victoria, it was decided to do nothing about this because it was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfaites accomplis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. To transalate the English version of the book into French would have cost considerable amount of money. Cercle du Livre had extensive distribution networks in Quebec and to fight this in court would be expensive. There would be more money for Rein from invitations to give speeches in Quebec. The French version became a best seller in Quebec and was adopted as a text in several colleges and universities. Rein became a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccause c\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8bre\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Quebec and was ultimately satisfied with the outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein returned to Toronto to give a lecture at the foundation meeting of YESS (York Enterprise Study System) the assistance programme started by Professor Eric Winter, Master of Calumet College at York University, which supported arts students wishing to start businesses or helped the poor people living around the campus to improve their lot through self-started enterprises. Rein was eventually named a Fellow of Calumet College. \\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 26 Rein flew to Ottawa to address a meeting of the Science Council with a critique of a research publication by Drs. Gilmour and Brittain. Rein met with Skelton of the Small Business Development Office of ITC, before returning to Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 18 Rein drove to Kingston to be a featured speaker of Q\\xe2\\x80\\x99BET the loacal annual research lecture series set up by the Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Business School.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 10 Meeting of The Junior Achievement Board of Governors (to which belonged the Canadian business elite and Rein as the token academic) in the top floor executive dining room of The Royal Bank of Canada, of the gold embedded glass tower in downtown Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\n1979\\r\\nAyatollah Khomeini Returns as Leader of Iran \\r\\nIran Imprisons American Hostages in Tehran \\r\\nMargaret Thatcher, First Woman Prime Minister of Great Britain \\r\\nMother Teresa Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \\r\\nNuclear Accident at Three Mile Island \\r\\nSony Introduces the Walkman \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 10 Jennifer-Mai Charlotte was born. She waited until about 4:00 A.M., before informing Mom. Dad, with Mom in tow, had to dash down the Gardner Expressway, by car, to Western Hospital. As we arrived at the designated back door, Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwater broke\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Rein paniced, afraid that the baby would fall out on the sidewalk. Reassured by Mari, we made it to the appropriate nurse and attendants. Rein was shuffled off to a waiting room. He had brought along several books expecting a long wait He also had been told by Dr. Dymon that the baby would be delivered by a Dr. Wong, because he was getting a little too old for doing births.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein could unclearly hear all the calls made on the hospital loudspeaker system. Suddenly there were several calls, for, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. W---g, Dr. W---g, report immediately to the oprating room!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After the third call, Rein went out into the corridor and saw an Oriental-looking man in hospital robes walking slowly down the hall. Rein, in his anxiety, grabbed the man by the front of his garment and asked him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you Dr. Wong, you have to get into the delivery room and deliver my baby!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shocked the Oriental-looking man, a little scared, stuttered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNO, NO \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 me no Wong, solly!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein apologized and let him go. \\r\\n \\r\\nRein was finally escorted to the birthing room and did his duty about checking all the toes and fingers, as with Mike. All was well! \\r\\nJennifer-Mai Charlotte was born on January 10. 1979. Weight 8 Lbs. 7 oz. at time 0748. Her tag said  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cApgar 10. First breastfeed 1330. OK. Not 3 minutes but 3 good pulls each breast. Sneezed and snorted and fell asleep --- \\xc2\\xbd oz. glucose. Nurse said she is a good girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nMari chose the name Jennifer, and we jointly had agreed previously that we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to know whether the first child was going to be boy or girl in May (that is, no ultra-sound peeking was allowed by Mari). Therefore the middle name was chosen to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMai\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the Estonian name for the month of May, the birth month of Michael. Our nutty idea was that we thus were denoting a bond between our two children. Rein got to choose the third name \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because he thought it was regal sounding, and Jenny was probably conceived in Chatlottetown, at the Motel-On-The-Hill. Young Jenny came to be called, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD-D-D, Daddy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Darling Daughter, Princess, Boom-Boom!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Oh well, Jenny didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like Charlotte and soon grew out of liking the Boom, Boom part roo. C\\xe2\\x80\\x99est la vie! When Rein came to check out Mari and Jenny from the hospital, the cashier told Rein that the total bill would be seven dollars, Rein informed the cashier that his Jenny was worth much more than that, but decided not to argue with socialized medicine. The seven dollars was for the telephone.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan.13 Rein travelled to Prince Edward County, to Athol Corners, to look at a farm that was for sale. Snow covered the ground and Bill Rorabeck, the real estate agent and Rein walked the 110 acres together. Three fields, with Class \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d soil were being rented by neighbours for planting corn. There was one beautiful old yellow house, a second, partially standing brick house, but the original homestead lay dilapidated, abandoned. One majestic old beautiful wooden barn, that needed some loving care, with an adjacent building that had been used to keep chickens and fowl. A garage filled with rusting old farming equipment stood next to the chiken coop.  Behind and South of the main house, were 3 cottages that had been used as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfactories\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to pack boiled chickens in glass jars, labeled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWillowbank\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for sale to the general public. It became obvious then, that, on the south side of the house stood, in a row, 5 huge Willow trees, on a slight rise. The rest of the farm was covered with apple and cherry trees. The Ethel Noble (ex-orchard) farm was listed for $38,000. She was the last remaining, and youngest, at 92 years, old maid, daughter of a large Noble family that had been the original settlers. The Petersons would become the second minders of the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein took some pictures of the farm to Mari, who was still in hospital with baby Jennifer, and she agreed that we could buy the farm with a mortgage. (We had recently paid off the mortgage on our city home). We decided to name the farm, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWILLOWBANK\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was going to be our own little \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJalna\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a small hamlet/homestead, like in our favourite television show, The Whiteoaks of Jalna (1972). Which was based on the classic Canadian 1927 novel written by Mazo de la Roche. The TV Jalna was about a farm owned by a real wealthy man who farmed as a hobby. The Jalna farm was in Southern Ontario near Lake Ontario like our Willowbank.  Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother Kenn, agreed to live on farm and look after the animals. Romulus and Alma were to also come and live on the farm. Rein was going to try and get an appointment at nearby Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s School of    Business.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonis Laar, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend, acted as lawyer on our farm real estate deal. Tonis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mother looked after Rein and Tonis in the Geislingen, Baden- Wurtenberg, displaced persons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 camp. We both came to her home after school, starting somewhere in 1946. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father was working as a policeman all day. We have been on and off friends ever since. He is Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longest known friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first animals we acquired were 6 pigs from a Lesbian couple who were introduced to us by Eric Winter, the Master of Calumet College, and author of a book on \\xe2\\x80\\x9chobby\\xe2\\x80\\x9d farming, that caught our attention. Eric and family were operating a farm themselves and talked Rein into doing it also. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had to fix the fence around the pig pen, and ran a huge thick water hose to the piggery from the well at the side of the house for water. We had to erect special devices, from the local store, which allowed the pigs to drink, by pushing with their snouts. Pigs are very smart and learned the trick quickly. Eventually, Rein convinced his academic colleagues to buy each one of the pigs and Rein promised to feed each one a diet that was specified by the owner. Most owners opted to having their pigs eat apples, which were readily available from untended trees on the farm. Rein claimed that the pig meat had a taste of apple sauce ingested. We also encouraged the owners to visit the farm and introduce their children to the pig and farm. We called our small operation \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccustom growing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We were sure we could develop a lot of other product lines for the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to think of our farm as only a hobby farm, and had a vision of trying to prove that it was possible to run a 110 acre farm that was financially self-sustaining, in the 1980s. Mari, as a child psychologist, wanted to try and run a business to rehabilitate mothers-in-distress and their children, using the three cottages on the property. Rein subsequently applied to the National Research Council to have them build a refrigeration plant on the farm. An experiment was proposed to see if it was economically feasible to raise carrots in season, freeze them, and then release them on the Canadian market during January-February when imported carrot prices into Canada were high. NRC subsequently withdrew from the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farm had three operating fields, which had been rented out to neighbor farmers, who grew corn on them, as feed for cattle, in the winter time.To keep the weeds low, the practice in Prince Edward County had been, for years, to spray an aggressive, nondegenerating drug called Atrocene on the weeds in the fields. As a consequence all humus in the soil was destroyed and the worm count on our fields was lower than that required to have the debris (the stalks), left after harvesting, rot and enrich next season\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crop. The County government agricultural agents told Rein that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agricultural practices used the soil only to hold up the stalks and all nutrient chemicals were applied to the soil by spraying, to make the corn grow. Rein thought that this was absolute nonsense. The chemicals each year leached out of the ground and polluted the local drainage water courses and threatened the water table, in the long-run. Rein pulled all three fields out of production and let them lay fallow for a year. On one of the three fields Rein had neighbour, a Dutch farmer, DeHahn, sow Treefoil, which had a reputation of reclaiming the soil from the chemicals.The idea was to see what the effects would be. Next year 4 heifers were bought to eat the grass on the new Treefoil field which had recovered and was verdant.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo bring chickens to the farm, Rein and Kenn built a chicken coop by renovating a part of an old barn. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother, Marta, became very involved, remembering her former childhood duties on an Estonian farm. The eggs were sold by her at the Estonian House in Toronto at a premium price. The chickens were free-ranging and for some reason produced a disproportionate number of brown eggs that were highly valued and overdemanded at the Toronto Estonian House. Marta became a cause c\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8bre with her friends who had grown up in Estonia, eating brown eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 25 Canadian Regional (Rural) Development Conference, CRDC, was held in Ottawa, Rein was an invited speaker. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein, became formally the Director of Entrepreneurial Studies, and launched the first credited undergraduate course in Canada: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEntrepreneurship and New Ventures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The first lecture/workshops had been taught by Rein, using discontinued course numbers, since 1972. The undergraduates proved to be more entrepreneurial than the MBA students that dreamed of landing a cushy job at a bank or some other large organization. Rein was one of the first one in the world, to launch an Entrepreneurial Studies Programme at the Graduate and Undergraduate levels in the world. Twelve of us, facing similar situations, from across North America, eventually started to meet separately, at academic conferences to share experiences and to plan for the entrepreneurship academic future. We called ourselves, as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwelve Deciples\\xe2\\x80\\x9d propagating the message of entrepreneurship around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 11 On the farm, we were surveying, and learning what, exactly, we had bought.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 15 Rein had become a member of the Board of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBusiness Warriors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a radical lobby group for the interests of small business owners that were inadequately served by governments and big institutions like banks. These males in their mid to late 20s were copying the confrontation and demonstrative approaches, of the time in the USA, when demanding legislative or business practice changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 23 Rein became a member of the Board of the large, York University affiliated, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstitute of Behavioral Research\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that served university researchers with statistical expertese and carried out large public surveys in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 28 Rein was working with CFIB on a submission to the Federal Minister of Small Business, Tony Abbott and Prime Minister Jean Chretien.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 1 Rein met with Leo Legrove, Senior Vice-President of RoyNat, a private lender and investor in owner-managed firms. Rein made a presentation to their Board, entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Importance of Interest Rates to Owner-managed Firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, reporting on research he had carried out (as a Reimar consultant) with owner-managed firms. Rein had concluded that interest rates mattered less than quick access to funds, when they were needed. This finding was received by the board as a calling for radical changes in RoyNat lending policies and some changes resulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 12 We metwith Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teacher, Mrs. Elgar at Humber Valley Public School. Michael was struggling at his school. Mari and Rein were dissatisfied with the teachers and withdrew Micheal from the school next year to go to a private school.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 22, Rein at meeting in Picton on severance hearing, whereby one acre of farm and the old house, that was on it, that needed renovation, were severed in the name Kenneth M. Paulus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 24 FAS MBA (Graduation) Ball, Rein represented friend Wallace B. Crowston, who was Dean and delivered the Faculty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech. No one recognized Rein in his tuxedo and Mari in a fancy dress, and thought that Rein was the hotel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Maitre-D, and asked for the direction to the bathrooms. A lot of hilarity and embarrassment resulted when Rein stood up to give the dinner address on behalf of the Dean and made fun of the question as to where the toilets were..\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 3 Rein started to write a series of articles on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Importance of Small Business and entrepreneurship in the Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, for the independent, best business newspaper in Canada, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Financial Post\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which appeared with full photographs of Rein and his message for several weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 10 Rein at meeting in Ottawa with Skelton of the Small Business Group and representatives from Industry Trade and Commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 11 -12 Rein lectured at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Engineering Faculty on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation and Entrepreneurship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This became an annual affair in the Spring. The City of Winnipeg would usually be just escaping from their hard winter and the roads would always be wet and slossy. The people always seemed a little bit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgiddy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, after waiting for the thaw a long time. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yearly arrival became an auspicious occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 19 - 22 & April 29- 30 we were living at the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 11 Mike was seven years old. Mari was teaching every Tuesday and Thursday for the next several months, while Rein acted as babysitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 17 - 21 We moved to our Farm, Willowbank for at least the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 28 Romulus visited the farm and was willing to move there; he was very excited about the prospects. Stepmother nixed this plan and refused to live on a farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5, 9 - 10 at the farm, we had a telephone hooked up. Rein asked DeHahn, a neighbour, to plow one field with Treefoil, to be left fallow for one year. The remaining 2 fields were rented to neighbours DeHahn and Mann, for raising corn, again. The worm count was still below normal level needed to have corn stalks naturally recycled (rot) after harvest. Rein and Mari worried about what was happening to their good grade \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x99 agricultural land.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 7 Rein flew to University of Windsor for a research workshop & appeared on local CBC-TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 17 Rein had breakfast at Hotel Toronto with Pat Johnson, the new Research Director at CFIB. Jim Conrad had been fired.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 23 At farm, and in Montreal for government meetings, supper with Romulus and Jaan Kiis.\\r\\n \\r\\nJune 23 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 June 27Mari and Rein in Quebec City for the Founding of Canadian Council of Small Business organizational meetings. Rein gave the Inaugural Speech and sat on supervisory panels of the papers presented. \\r\\n\\r\\nJune 28 All day Meetings with Ontario Ministers lead by Grossman, organized by CFIB, in the Hearst Board Room at Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 29 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 We held the first \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWillowbank Festival\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the farm, with invited guests and visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 3 Rein delivered invited series of lectures at Universite de Trois Rivieres.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 3\\xe2\\x80\\x93 10, 13 - 16 Mari, Jenny and Mike moved to farm and Rein commuted to work at York.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 17 Meeting with Business Warriers in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 21 Kenn bought a 1968 blue pick-up truck for C$1195 with his credit card and seemed to want to really participate in the activities of the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 25 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 Mari working with poratable typewriter (personal computers had not yet been developed as yet), along with Mike and Rein at farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 7 - 9 Rein in Halifax presenting research on Small Business Development Centres on ATV. The interviewer and some others attacked Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentation and Rein lost his cool and counter-attached forcefully. The TV pilot became a valuable video for use in the classroom. Rein was invited back two more times to appear on the show. Clearly all TV directors love some harmless controversy and emotion on the TV screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 8 PhD examination held for Knud Jensen, one of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PhD students, he failed his comprehensive exam. During his career Rein supervised a total of 9 PhD students: Alan Daly (withdrew), Hughes Roy (failed comprehensive examination), Ron Mulholland (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDealing with Entrepreneurial Uncertainty: Do Current Measures of Overconfidence Tell the Whole Story?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Owen Pegg (Became an ABD, when he decided to start another new business in the UK. He had failed 4 times previously). Several years later, he published a paper, under Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervision, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOwen Pegg, a Serial Entrepreneur?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had failed again. Alex Stewart, an anthropologist (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Bigman Metaphor for Entrepreneurship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Richard LeBlanc (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInside the Boardroom: How Boards Really Work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Neil Wolff (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn Interpretation of Entrepreneurial Signals Received by Venture Capital Resource Providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Neil went through a terrible divorce and failed to complete his dissertation. A female PhD student from India was caught by Rein plagerizing, while taking Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PhD Research Seminar and was expelled from the University. Rein also sat on several other PhD examination boards, around the world, as an outside observer.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhD examinations could be very discouraging, Rein remembers that previously, a PhD student at The Graduate School of Business, Columbia University in New York City, failed his Comprehensive examination, when he did not know that different countries had different currencies. He was a Linear Programming (mathematics) nerd who presented a PhD thesis on international economics using fancy mathematical and computer techniques. Where was his Thesis chairman all the time is still a mystery? Rein was a member of the examination committee. Rein, during his career, also supervised around 350 MBA theses (MGMT 601) at The Schulich School of Business, York University.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct.25 Rein delivered an Executive Development lecture on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeregulation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at Triumph Hotel for The Executive Development Division of the Faculty of Administrative Studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov.17 Rein had an extensive meeting with Leon Danco, author of Beyond Survival, and the most successful Family Business academic, lecturer, icon and consultant in the USA.  His book, Beyond Survival, became \"the old testament of the family business field.\" He offered Rein a business partnership in his company, provided Rein would start a Canadian Family Business consulting business with him. Rein eventually declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 29 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 The year ended with Michael wanting to learn how to skate. Willowbank had acquired 16 chickens and several ducks, thanks to Kenn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1980\\r\\nFailed U.S. Rescue Attempt to Save Hostages in Tehran \\r\\nJohn Lennon Assassinated    \\r\\n\\r\\nJan.30  Brunch Meeting at 0800, with Steven Rankin, President of Cape Breton Development Corporation, at aToronto Airport Hotel. He offered me the job of Executive Vice-President -- Corporate Planning; with responsibility for the 4 Divisions of Marketing, Coal Technology Research, Management Information Systems and Corporate Planning. I would also serve as Chair of the Economic Development Advisory Committee of Cape Breton Island (which eventually never amounted to anything in practice).\\r\\n\\r\\nRankin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer was very attractive financially, and seemed to follow exactly the recommendations that were made by a former student, Jim Plumtree, whom Rein had coached on his first big consulting project for the Federal Government and Cape Breton Development Corporation. Rein accepted the contract that was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliterally\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tailor-made for him. The student had recommended Rein for the job. Rein only accepted a two year term, subject to renewal if both parties agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein asked Steve Rankin, how he would be judged and evaluated. Rankin responded by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will depend on what you leave behind for the people of Cape Breton, when you leave\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. All Capers were very proud of their Island and thought that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople from away\\xe2\\x80\\x9d only came to the Island temporarily. One of the most popular local songs sang, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Canso Causeway was built for going away!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRein subsequently negotiated a two year, unpaid leave-of-absence, from Schulich School of Business. Dezso Horvath, a good friend, and Dean made the recommendation to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. From 1980-1982 Dr. James Darroch, a Rein prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9, was named Director of Entrepreneurial Studies, while Rein was on unpaid leave. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a two year leave-of-absence from York University, Rein was to help with the turnaround of a company that had been losing money for more than 10 years. He was, ultimately, probably hired because of his best selling book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business: Building a Balanced Economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 6 - 7, 27, March 1, 2, 5  Rein and Mari, as Reimar and Associates consultants, prepared and submitted a document to the Economic Council of Canada on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Impact of Economic Regulation and Paperwork : Is Small Business Being Crushed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0As Reimar Associates, Rein and Mari had bid against Woods Gordon, a large international consulting firm, and it was decided by the Economic Council to divide the Request for Proposal in two, with Reimar being awarded the small firm sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 8 Rein and Mari were invited by Hickling-Johnson Consultants to Collingwood for a ski day company celebration. Rein had been advising Hickiling-Johnson for several years and attended their mneetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 13 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 15 Rein spent in Sydney, Cape Breton meeting his future colleagues and making arrangements for housing and the move.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 3 Joe Clark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minority government was defeated by a non-confidence motion in Ottawa. This had a significant impact on CFIB lobbying efforts for small business policy related issues and thereby on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advisory status. Joe Clark had been a supporter of Small Business in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 18 Rein was invited to serve on the board of Cabot Trust Company, owned by Italians, by one of his former prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 students. Rein declined, being unsure of who all were involved.\\r\\n`\\r\\nMarch 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 26 We visited New Orleans for an academic conference with Mari, Dezso and Mona Horvath. We drove to Baylor University and Waco, where later a big disaster happened when an extremist religious fanatic set his compound on fire and more than 100 adherents were burned alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 7 Rein and Mari were on the farm. Kenneth had been looking after 8 pigs, 4 cattle and numerous fowl. We had sold one sheep and ate the other. We had named them after Greek heros, Icarius and Apollo, and Mike found it disgusting to eat a family \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. No animals were to be named subsequently.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 18 Rein met Rankin and Doug Field, VP Coal Mining, from CBDC, Sydney in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 23 - 24 Globe and Mail announced Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment in the Report on Business and Rein visited DEVCO in Sydney to get to know his 4 division responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 29 Rein met with SB Capital, Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first venture capital firm (George Fels) and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former student Michael Mirski. He had been meeting with them regularly, as a part of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research efforts. \\r\\n\\r\\nMay1 Conference call with David Miller and John Dodge, two young Cape Breton VPs responsible for financing of new enterprises on the Island and for developing new venture start-ups. Both David and John visited Rein in Toronto. They were checking Rein out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 Mari visited Cape Breton to make arrangements for our move and we visited with Pearl and Jim Peers, the latter has been very keen on making a friendship with the new VP at DEVCO and had visited Rein in Toronto several times. Peers was helpful in trying to condition Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinking about the Corporation and the type of people Rein would meet from local business persons. The Jewish businessmen from Sydney eventually become excellent friends. This was especially the case with a local celebrity, Harvey Webber, a retail clothing merchant from Sydney, Nova Scotia, who had founded Atlantic Canada Plus in 1977 and wanted Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement. Harvey\\'s message was similar to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuilding a Balanced Economy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  It was simple and straightforward:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c. .. we are regarded as the underachievers of Canada and remain the poor end of the country ... when the Government of Canada gives money to the people in the Atlantic Provinces, it is merely giving money to consumers who will buy products made in the constituencies of [central Canadian] Cabinet Ministers. The more money they gave us, the more we sent back to buy their goods. It was really self-help for their constituents... there would be no permanent improvement if we got more money that way. It depends on the handout psychology for funding the underdeveloped areas, and that is dangerous. These funds are distributed in such a way that they politicize the commercial activity in our province and municipalities. The Atlantic Canada market has a potential 2.2 million consumers to purchase competitive products and services made regionally ... if more Atlantic Canadians bought what is produced ... what we grow, catch, package, assemble or manufacture... in the region, it would create jobs here and make it possible for future generations to stay in Atlantic Canada and find jobs...\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nRein, of course agreed and provided Harvey with as much help as he could. Harvey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife, Pearl Peers and Mari joined forces, eventually, as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Shadow Council\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Sydney City Council and provided the citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 point of view and critical comment on the Councillors actions. Some of the Shadow Council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions appeared in Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, The Highlander, newspaper column that she began to write.\\r\\nMay 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 16. James Peers, a private consultant and subsequently a friend in Sydney, visited Rein in Toronto. He wanted to know what Rein was going to do with the consultants Hickling\\xe2\\x80\\x93Johnson \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCBDC Corporate Planning Study Proposal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein told him that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a consultant to help him do a corporate plan. That was Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal duty and challenge as Vice-President. Rein outlined the following:\\r\\na. The H-J Proposal was not appropriate.\\r\\nb. We will be writing our own consulting terms of reference. The terms of reference should flow from the data needs generated by the corporate planning initiated by Rein.\\r\\nc. Rein must slow down the consultants from rushing us to satisfy their own business priorities and needs.\\r\\nd. One of H-J Consultants, Claudia, was apparently already \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the various actors at CBDC and in Cape Breton. This must stop.\\r\\ne. PROBLEM: What to do about Rankin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verbal promise of 4 weeks of consulting to 2 H-J consultants, Claudia and 2 weeks to Plumtree (the son of a Liberal politician).\\r\\nPlumtree\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a politician trying to help her son, had not sent clear terms of reference, so she could be ignored. Claudia was limited by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terms of reference to writing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliterature review\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and did not contribute much, except introducing the important people aside from the Senior Executive Group in Cape Breton to Rein. Jim Peers seemed to be caught in two camps, Hickling-Johnson and his own consulting ambitions.\\r\\nIt was recommended to Rein to talk by telephone to David McKinnon, an important politician, by calling him via telephone at home in Nova Scotia. Mckinnon agreed that Hickling-Johnson study would be inappropriate. He was very concerned and sympathetic when he observed that:\\r\\na. CBDC faced two theoretical problems. How to support industrial development on the Island and how to solve its institutional problem as a viable crown corporation?\\r\\nb. DEVCO was not fulfilling its industrial development role on the Island. The Federal Government had delegated all development activities to DEVCO and the company had succeeded in doing very little since.\\r\\nc. He had always wanted to create a separate statistical economic data base for Cape Breton Island. (Rein saw this as a possible joint project, but it never came to be).\\r\\nd. DEVCO needed to develop an independent corporate strategy. Rein must not get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmixed up in the glue of the DREE bureaucracy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Ottawa. Rein should work directly with senior people in Ottawa: Tim Reid, ADM of DREE, Marc Daniels, Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet, for economic policy, Robbie Shaw at the MSED, formerly the Principal Assistant to the Premier of Nova Scotia. These were all senior political actors and Rein did not take up his offer to help him make new contacts.\\r\\ne. Rein eventually decided that he should try and prepare a corporate plan that would reach profitability by 2007 (25 years hence) because it would take that long for any new mine to become operational. It would assume that DEVCO coal could be sold internationally, at market price, new coal technology would be implemented in operations and an up to date M.I.S. System would improve decision-making at all levels. \\r\\n(Twenty-five years years later, in 2007, coal price actually reached $100 per ton, as Rein had forecast, but it collapsed 2 years later and decended to the price available at the end of the 1980s. By 2016 coal had become a despised, polluting, undesirable fuel. World demand for coal collapsed. If coal was to recover, major technological breakthroughs are needed. But Coal remains the most abundant and readily available fuel all over the world).\\r\\nRankin was not supportive of the corporate planning, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacademic theory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that Rein discussed with him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow much change can the company digest at one time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein went ahead and prepared a 25 year Strategic Overview for the DREE bureaucrats in Ottawa.\\r\\nf. Rein decided not to get involved in Island industrial development (political) projects. This would include efforts being made to get CBDC involved in off-shore oil and gas exploration (like in Newfoundland) and producing synthetic fuels from coal, as was being promoted by a former cabinet member. That is, CBDC should become an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cenergy company\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\ng. Jim Peers was intruding in every way he could with Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new job. He met with Rankin privately and spent a lot of time with David Miller and John Dodge of the Industrial Development Department. He said he wanted to help Rein and proposed many very radical ideas. It turned out eventually, that, as a private consultant, he had an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cassociate relationship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with Hickling-Johnson Consultants. He was clearly biased.\\r\\nh. Rein decided that Rankin had to set (especially the political) strategy for the company. Rein was there only to help him deliver the strategy agreed upon.\\r\\nMay 16 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Peterson family was on the farm.\\r\\nMay 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 27 Rankin was in Toronto and asked Rein to fly to Sydney to meet with persons who would report to him: Lloyd Creasor, Director of Marketing,  Roy McLean, Director of Coal Technology, Annette Verschuren, (whom Rein subsequently appointed) Director of Corporate Planning and Gerald McQuarry, Director, Management Information Systems and the Computer Centre.\\r\\nMay 31 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 June 2 Rein was working on improving fencing on the farm, using his new tractor. We had a young boy from India staying with Michael at the farm and they were very ready helpers. They especially enjoyed getting to ride on the tractor.\\r\\nJune 3 Open House for people interested in renting our home at 14 Hilldowntree Rd.\\r\\nJune 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 6 Packers pack-up furniture that we will take to Sydney and loaded a big moving truck.\\r\\nJune 8 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 12 Rein was in Sydney. Celebration of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavis Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in North Sydney, at the large memorial built in memory of\\xc2\\xa0William Davis, a coal miner who was killed during a mining strike near the town of\\xc2\\xa0New Waterford. The protest was in response to a decision by the mining company,\\xc2\\xa0British Empire Steel and Coal Company\\xc2\\xa0(a predessor firm to CBDC), to shut down the drinking water supply and electricity to the town of Sydney, as a result of escalating strikes.\\r\\nDavis had been shot and killed at approximately 11:00 AM on June 11, 1925 and many other miners were injured, when striking miners were charged by the company police force, whose officers reportedly fired over 300 shots. In the weeks and months following Davis\\' shooting, company facilities were looted and/or vandalized, despite the deployment of a provincial police force and 2,000 soldiers in what remains Canada\\'s second-largest military deployment for an internal conflict.\\r\\nRein was the only management person there and it was not clear whether he was welcome, among the very angry and emotional miners and their union leaders. He definitely was an outsider (several times over).\\r\\nJune 19 The Sheehan family received keys, as renters, to 14 Hilldowntree Rd. for a period of a 2 year contract.\\r\\nJune 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 25 Peterson Family stayed at farm. Rein bought two new steers.\\r\\nJune 25 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 27 At Mining Conference in Montreal, it became clear that the coal mining industry in Canada was dominated by Western firms. While the CBDC was located on the Eastern coast of Canada and had the easiest shipping access to Europe, Brazil and Argentina. An opportunity we needed to take advantage of.\\r\\nJune 28 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 Rein, Mari, Mike and baby Jenny drove to Edmunston and then on to Sydney, with their personal goods. Mari was with the children in our Toyota Crown, following Rein in a rented van. We were billeted in the executive suite at the Holiday Inn, next to the CBDC head office building, overlooking Sydney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Atlantic Harbour.\\r\\nJuly 14 Meetings took place to found the Cape Breton Junior Achievement Organization. Rein was elected president. Satellites were also founded in Isle Madame, Port Hawkesbury and Glace Bay. \\r\\nIsle Madame was a group of Islands inhabitated by French-speaking Acadians who were very independent and entrepreneurial. The local JA group was headed up by the local female mortician, ambulance driver and storekeeper. She was the best JA leader during the two years that Rein was  President.\\r\\nPort Hawkesbury was the town at the Cape Breton end of the Causeway from mainland Nova Scotia. It had a reputation, in a popular sad/lament folksong, as the location of the Causeway used especially by the young Island children to go and seek jobs on the mainland.\\r\\nAt Glace Bay, in the 1960s, Deuterium Canada Ltd., a private company, and the province of Nova Scotia had collaborated on construction of a new heavy water production plant among workers with no previous experience in the nuclear field. At the time, it was predicted that heavy water would be needed by a growing nuclear industry in Canada, and Nova Scotia and Ottawa were anxiously trying to create make-work employment on Cape Breton. The plant had technological problems and eventually labour problems and was rebuilt. The new plant started to rust, sucking up millions of dollars in repairs and reconstruction costs. The plant did not reach full production until the late 1970s and was eventually shut down in 1985. This was seen by Cape Bretoners as another major smear on the reputation of Cape Breton, where carte blanche plants, involving new technology, had failed several times before.\\r\\nSydney was of course seen as a government town, with government agencies, Stelco steel plant and Devco coal mines, all government owned.\\r\\nStarting Cape Breton Junior Achievement, to train young Capers, was therefore seen, enthusiastically, as a God-send by the parents who wanted their children to become job-ready. Volunteer adults were not hard to recruit and Devco paid the expenses that we were not able to raise through fundraising. CBJA, fulfilled President Rankin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenge of, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRein leaving something behind, when he left, in two years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thirty-five years later, in 2015, CBJA was still operating successfully.\\r\\nJuly 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 4 Rein was in Wolfville at the Canada Charter Discussions, representing CBDC and Cape Breton.\\r\\nJuly 10 The house for our family became available and we moved out of the Holiday Inn. The local children called our house an \\xe2\\x80\\x9capartment house\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because it had two separate entrance doors, one leading to the basement, where Michael and Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother lived. They had their own kitchen and bathroom. Mari, Jenny and Rein lived upstairs.\\r\\nJuly 16 First meeting with the private company, SNC, and Roy, on the possibilities of establishing a liquifaction plant, for our CBDC coal. The plant would manufacture energy from coal that would compete with natural gas.\\r\\nJuly 22 Marine related resource usage activities were discussed with Industrial Development Division, and delegated with Roy.\\r\\nJuly 23 Meeting was held with mine managers regarding R&D priorities. They were interested in local manufacturing of automatic mine roof supports and we discussed the problems of marketing our coal.\\r\\nJuly 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 28 Annual Celebrations and Yacht Race at Dundee.\\r\\nOne of the first memories from arriving in Sydney was walking with Doug Shields, Vice-President Coal Mining, down the road towards the Dundee Harbour, in front of the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s West Bay Resort and Yacht Club and Golf Club. The annual Cape Breton sailing race was about to leave port. Doug complained that he had been assigned by the president to sail on the corporate yacht \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCabot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Matthew\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the corporate representative. He said he would rather go golfing. He asked Rein to take his place, which he was more than happy to do. \\r\\nUpon stepping on the deck of the sailboat, Rein felt an instant connection to it, as if his Livonian Viking genes had been awakened. Terry Burns was the skipper of a crew of CBDC employees who were making many disheartened comments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe always come in last! We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to match the smaller racing craft\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein, as Vice-President, was the ranking person on the boat, as it sailed out of harbour, heading for the starting line. He shouted at the crew on board that he was not a quitter and if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wish to win \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go back and let me off the boat. I do not wish to lose even before we start the race\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein had not yet become accustomed to his new powerful position.The immediate reaction of most \\xe2\\x80\\x9cemployees\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on board was to deny their lack of interest in winning the race.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt turned out that Terry Burns was an experienced sailor, who had crossed the Atlantic in a sailboat and as a result the Cabot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Matthew made an excellent start to the race. But the winds were light, and the Matthew being the largest boat in the fleet, was passed by several smaller boats. Four hours later, racing on the way back to the finish line, we approached Sporting Mountain. Conventional wisdom had it that around 1600 the bay would experience an offshore wind and most of the fleet turned into the bay to catch this strong wind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want to do Dr.Peterson? Should we follow them into the bay?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\nRein asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat are our choices?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and was told that we could maintain course and hope that current wind would carry us beyond the bay. If we succeeded, and the current wind didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disappear, Terry estimated that we could finish near the top of the list. Otherwise, if we followed the rest into the bay we could come in last (again). Rein responded saying that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen there is no choice to make, let us take a chance and head for the finish line!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cabot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Matthew came in fourth, an excellent result for the type of boat it was, and this resulted in much merriment and cheers from the crew. And Rein was hooked on sailing and racing for the next 19 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t----------------------\\r\\nLIST OF SAIL BOATS THAT REIN HAS CREWED ON IN HIS LIFETIME: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCABOT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S MATTHEW\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, 36 ft. Cabotcraft, at Dundee West Bay, Cape Breton. Rein was one of 3 authorized Skippers for the Cape Breton Development Corporation boat. Sailed with Mari, Michael, Stott, Ottmuller, 1980-82.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAURORA BOREALIS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, 26 ft., Tanzer at Baddeck, Cape Breton , lent by a mutual sailing friend, Rein served as skipper with Mari, 1981.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSEVERAL DIFFERENT BOATS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Bluenose, 18 ft., TORONTO, Harbourside Sailing School while pursuing an Intermediate Cruising Certificate , as student/skipper, 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMORNING MIST\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, 26 ft. C&C, KINGSTON, Ont., 1984, Rein served as co-skipper while being tested for a rating of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCYA Intermediate Offshore Skipper Certificate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the disturbed waters of the St. Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLA MOUSTACE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, 45 ft. Beneteau, across the BALTIC SEA from Nordhammar, Sweden to Helsinki, Finland and return, Rein served as co-skipper, Summer 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTAHITI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,  AURORA 45 ft., charter from Toronto to Niagara-on-the-Lake and return, during the unexpected Streetsville Tornado, Rein served as single-handed skipper and had limited crew to help him, Mari, Fedchuns, and a statistician from IBR, 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPAGAN\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, C&C, 35 ft., Racing out of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club,  Rein served as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnaviguesser\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (navigator). Rein only had LORAN C radio equipment, tracing 3 radio beams, broadcast from locations along the East coast of USA, between New York City and Philadelphia.The radio equipment was dated and unreliable. Rein often had to quess where exactly on Lake Ontario we were during a race. We won the Harrison Cup and placed first in the LORC II races one season, 1983 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cANTARES LENNUK\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, 30ft. Alberg, Toronto Island Marina, RCYC, Port Credit Marina, Belle River & Lake St.Clair, Windsor, Owner and Skipper. Rein sailed mostly single-handed on Toronto Bay, Lake Ontario and with Mari and Jenny down St. Lawrence River East until Thousand Islands Parkway Bridge, East of Ganonaque, Lake St. Clair near Detroit. Mari, Jennifer, Scruffy,1989 \\xe2\\x80\\x931996.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCAPER\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Tanzer, 26 ft., charter for E/WEE, Toronto Bay Rein was skipper for the last time. He ended up in hospital because of overstraining his quadruple-bypass surgery heart, while handling the boat single-handed, since no one else on board had ever sailed before. That was the end to Sailor Rein, 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 6 Visit by CBDC supervising Ottawa government ministry and DREE (Department of Regional Economic Evaluation) officials, who were snooping around looking for data and information relating to assumptions behind Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Corporate Plan, the first Plan that had been composed for several years. The plan showed how CBDC could be debt free and viable by 2007, to everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 16 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 18 Team of Cape Breton Junior Achievement students travelled to Vancouver to participate in Canada-wide competitions, winning several trophies and scholarships. Upon return, celebrations by large groups of parents and friends was held in Sydney, Isle Madame and Glace Bay. (Steven Rankin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenge to Rein to leave something behind for citizens of Cape Breton was thereby well fulfilled. CBJA continued to operate successfully in 2015, whereas the Corporation DEVCO, of which Rein was Vice-President, went bankrupt in the 1990s).\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 19 Lloyd Creasor, Director of Marketing travelled to Brazil, to explore a new market, with a sales strategy worked out with Rein and Steven Rankin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 20 -21 Corporate Strategy teaching sessions were conducted by Dezso Horvath to the Senior CBDC Executive at Normaway lodge in the Margaree, a very beautiful place.\\r\\n \\r\\nAug 23 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Aug. 25 Sailing with Mari, Michael, little Jenny, Dezso, Mona, on board the corporate sailboat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCabot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Matthew\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Lac Bras D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Or. Rein had to skipper single-handedly, because the others had no experience in sailing a 36 foot boat. Rein, a recent convert was thankful that the Cabot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Matthew was a very forgiving boat, that Rein had become to love. We explored every nook and cranny of the lake including the Indian Reservations of Escasoni. The island contains five\\xc2\\xa0reserves\\xc2\\xa0of the\\xc2\\xa0Mi\\'kmaq Nation: Eskasoni, Membertou, Wagmatcook, Waycobah and Potlotek/Chapel Island. \\r\\nDuring the\\xc2\\xa0Anglo-French War\\xc2\\xa0of 1627 to 1629, Sir James Stewart of Killeith,\\xc2\\xa0Lord Ochiltree\\xc2\\xa0planted a colony on Cape Breton Island at\\xc2\\xa0Baleine,  and Alexander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son,\\xc2\\xa0William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, established the first incarnation of\\xc2\\xa0\"New Scotland\"\\xc2\\xa0at\\xc2\\xa0Port Royal (Cape Breton Island). A strong Scottish tradition and practice remains, scattered all over the Island today. The Government of Scotland recently sent a mission to Cape Breton to study the original ancient Gaelic spoken by the people in the isolated hills of the Island.\\r\\nThe French quickly defeated the Scottish at\\xc2\\xa0Baleine, and established the first permanent settlements on \\xc3\\x8ele Royale: present day\\xc2\\xa0Englishtown\\xc2\\xa0(1629) and\\xc2\\xa0St. Peter\\'s\\xc2\\xa0(1630), on Lac Bras D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Or, remain from these times. \\r\\nThe Island also saw active settlement by\\xc2\\xa0France. After the French ceded their colonies on\\xc2\\xa0Newfoundland\\xc2\\xa0and the\\xc2\\xa0Acadian\\xc2\\xa0mainland to the British by the\\xc2\\xa0Treaty of Utrecht\\xc2\\xa0in 1713, the French relocated the population of\\xc2\\xa0Plaisance, Newfoundland, to Isle Madame on\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x8ele Royale. It was decided to construct a very large fortification at\\xc2\\xa0Louisbourg\\xc2\\xa0to improve defences at the entrance to the\\xc2\\xa0Gulf of Saint Lawrence\\xc2\\xa0and to defend France\\'s fishing fleet on the\\xc2\\xa0Grand Banks.The French also built the\\xc2\\xa0Louisbourg Lighthouse\\xc2\\xa0in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America. Both of these are now monuments protected by Heritage Canada and recognized by historians worldwide. In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of \\xc3\\x8ele Royale also included\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x8ele Saint-Jean, today called\\xc2\\xa0Prince Edward Island. \\r\\nThe only remnants of the former colonial empire of\\xc2\\xa0New France that remain under\\xc2\\xa0French\\xc2\\xa0control are the St. Pierre and Miquelon Islands,\\xc2\\xa0with a population of 6,080 French citizens (at the January 2011 census). \\r\\nThe islands are situated at the entrance of\\xc2\\xa0Fortune Bay, which extends into the southern coast of\\xc2\\xa0Newfoundland, near the\\xc2\\xa0Grand Banks.\\xc2\\xa0They are 3,819 kilometres (2,373\\xc2\\xa0mi) from\\xc2\\xa0Brest, the nearest point in Metropolitan France,\\xc2\\xa0but only 25 kilometres (16\\xc2\\xa0mi) from the\\xc2\\xa0Burin Peninsula\\xc2\\xa0of Newfoundland, Canada.\\r\\n  \\r\\nAug. 31- Sept. 7 Wedding Anniversary was celebrated at the Farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 4 Rein was in Moncton reporting to the DREE regional office.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 6 Rein appeared on CBC Documentary in Sydney about CBDC and the coal industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 8 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10 Rein in Ottawa as Board Member of The Great Lakes Waterways Development Association. Meetings were held with various Government officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 11 Dezso Horvath Lectured to Coal Division managers. This was also Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 12 Meeting with major German customer, Otto Ottmuller Ltd. Otto became a good friend and was a fellow sailor. He visited Sydney several times bringing cases of Saar-Mosel-Ruwer wine.\\r\\n \\r\\nSept. 13 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19. Rein wa in Alberta at Canadian Coal Conference of all Canadian producing coal mines. Rein visited several Candian mines at Manalta-Highvale and Luscar, outside Edmonton, Petro Canada and Nova outside Calgary.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 22 Senior Executive Group Meeting of DEVCO held at Sydney.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 26 Horvath delivered another Corporate Planning Session at CBDC, followed by Senior Executive Group Meeting.\\r\\n \\r\\nSept.  28 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 In Ottawa for meetings with DREE and EMR. Roy McLean, Director of Coal Technology Research, reporting to Rein, had been negotiating with EMR and National Research Council to locate a Coal Technology Research Center in Sydney. As a result currently a Verschuren Research Centre exists at Cape Breton University. Annette Verschuren was hired by Rein to be Director of Corporate Planning at CBDC. She was the first and only female senior manager at DEVCO at the time. She helped prepare the Corporate Plan with Rein on the Computers. Subsequently, she was appointed CEO of Home Depot and several other similar large corporations. She became wealthy and donated the money to fund the Cape Breton University Research Centre and is currently (2015) the Chancellor of Cape Breton University.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 30 Meeting with managers on developing a corporate planning strategy for DEVCO Prince and Donkin mines.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 3-8 In Halifax with Mari for some tourism. Rein at Canadian Institute for Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Meetings. Rein with Lloyd Creasor, Director of Marketing, for price negotiating with the Nova Scotia Power Corporation, a major customer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 9 Offshore Oil and Gas Workshop. CBDC was exploring the possibility of Cape Breton getting involved in the offshore oil exploration ongoing in Newfoundland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 10 Office reorganization with Bruce McDade, Corporate Secretary and Senior Advisor to the President took place. Rein had discovered that the DEVCO computers were located downtown Sydney on the second floor of the local bus company garage, which had large oil storage facilities. Rein raised the alarm that this was too dangerous and threatened the ability of the M.I.S. Division, reporting to Rein, to meet the crucial payroll delivery to management and 11 unions. This resulted in a decision to move the new computers Rein had chosen, with McQuarrie, the Director of M.I.S., to the first floor of the Cabot Building, an 11-floor main office building. Locating the new computers visibly, behind safety glass, on first floor, was intended to project DEVCO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up-to-date image. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis resulted in the 4 Divisions, reporting to Rein, having to move onto a single floor. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office was a large corner office with large windows over-looking Kings Road, the main highway/street into and out of Sydney. Everyone could see Rein working in the office. There was some jealousy among some managers. Lloyd Creasor made an appeal to Rein that he would like to have that office. He had worked at DEVCO a very long time, and would like to show his family and friends that he had a fancy office, before he retired. Lloyd was a good man and Rein exchanged offices with him and made him very happy. At the same time, Rein discovered that Lloyd was paid $1,000 a year less than Roy McLean, with whom he had joined the company at the same time. Both were born in Sydney and went to school together. Rein corrected the discrepancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 11 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 17 Trip to Europe to visit coal mines and related research facilities. Rein spent 3 days in U.K. with mining contact Phil Reid. Coal industry in UK was in demise with many old mines being closed for safety reasons. Rein flew to Frankfurt and from there to Saarbruken. Spent several days visiting the coal mines, often crawling on his knees and hands in the tunnels which were not as well carved and maintained as back home at DEVCO. In Frankfurt Rein was shown the extensive research facilities related to processing coal and its impurities \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 very impressive. Rein bought an expensive blue set of dishes, including magnificent soup bowls manufactured by an internationally well known local firm.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 17 Rein addressed APPSA Energy Panel at Cape Breton College.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 19 Lloyd Creasor off on an international sales trip to West Germany, Sweden, and Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 24 Rein gave luncheon speech at Cape Breton College, outlining the necessity of doing coal technology research locally.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 27 Rein working with Doug Shield, in Glace Bay, on Corporate Plan writeup.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 29 Rein spent full day at planning Meetings of Junior Achievement Cape Breton board and management.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 4 Ronald Reagan elected President of USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov.6 Senior Executive Group meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 7 Meeting with Mine No. 26 management on the Corporate Plan writeup.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov.11 Rein helped prepare Special Industrial Development funding request.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 12 Meeting with Bill Mckenzie, metallurgist, reporting to Rein, on the VJ Coal Preparation Plant. \\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19. CBDC Board Meetings. Rein, as Corporate Planner, sat at Board table ex-officio, to make sure that his Corporate Plan was in harmony with the corporate strategy debated at the Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 20 Meeting with Greg McQuarrie regarding the new computers the corporation was going to acquire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 22 Loyd Creasor on sales trip to Brazil, with Colin Campbell, our metallurgist. The meeting in Brazil would be with a panel of Generals representing the dictatorship. We had concocted a sales strategy which promised the Brazilians a price advantage in buying Western Canada (open-pit) coal. Colin Campbell had worked out a metallurgical blending strategy with our CBDC (underground-mined) coal, which would allow the Brazilians to buy Western Canada coal at a lower price. We succeeded, at the shagrin of Western Canada companies, with a joint sales-pricing strategy with Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 1- 2 Meetings in Ottawa with N.R.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 10 Rein at National Energy Board Hearings in Halifax at the Chateau Halifax Hotel. Historically, the Nuclear Industry experts had always attached the Coal Industry, for polluting the environment and especially CBDC, for not being financially viable, and commercially competitive. Rein attacked, unexpectaedly, the Hydro-electric industry for not pricing their impact on the Canada taxpayer properly. He pointed out that the present value of the most valuable farming land in valleys and other dammed and flooded facilities, that was being lost forever, were not included in their Cost Impact Statements. When voiciferous debate broke out, Rein attached the Nuclear Industry Costing calculations for not allowing for the destruction of the waste end products. He also pointed out that the LeProux, N.B. new nuclear plant construction had been several years past due date and these costs had not been allowed for in the costing of nuclear power. The Energy Board was made up of Federal politicians who seemed to enjoy Rein counter-strategy. Colin Campbell was of course the architect of the technical details presented by Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 11 Rein and Gregg McQuarry met with the IBM representatives to plan for the cost and and technical support (from Montreal) on buying of an IBM 38 central computer system. According to IBM, the IBM 38 computer had supposedly been designed to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cidiot proof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in backing-up the operating personnel, who had very limited expertise at CBDC (except for the old IBM 360 machine, that was being discontinued). Rein arranged for the parallel running of payrolls on the IBM 360 at the other large company in town, Sysco, the steel rails manufacturer. We ran the pay roll twice, at both places, until we were confident that the new IBM 38 payroll system was delivering the same output. Pheww !!!\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 15 Annette Verschuren was hired by Rein to be the Director of Corporate Planning.\\r\\n\\r\\n1981\\r\\nAssassination Attempt of the Pope \\r\\nAssassination Attempt on U.S. President Reagan \\r\\nFirst Woman Appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court \\r\\nMillions Watch Royal Wedding on T.V. \\r\\nNew Plague Identified as AIDS \\r\\nPersonal Computers (PCs) Introduced by IBM \\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 13 Senior Executive Meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 21 First run of DEVCO Corporate Planning Model on our new computers. We reported that the respective Metallurgical Coal/Thermal coal percentages of  Mine outputs were as follows: No.26: 90/10, Lingan: 75/25, Prince: 0/100, Donkin: 0/100, Lingan-Phalen: 50/50.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 31 Rein In Ottawa for Great Lakes Waterways Association Board Meeting. Rein in Kingston for Faculty Seminar and workshop with PhD candidates at Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s University. Rein in Moncton for meetings with DREE Regional officials, Marshall Moffit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 2 Rein met with McClean and Rankin on establishing an Atlantic Coal Institute at Cape Breton College. It became clear that Verschuren was also interested and committed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 10 Meeting in Halifax \\xe2\\x80\\x93 IBM Long-Range Plan, followed by a meeting with Graham Skerret, Treasurer, M. Buchanan and Rankin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 16 Board of Trade meeting with Lloyd Creasor, on the future of CBDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 17 Meeting at the VJ Preparation Plant with Creasor, Shield regarding how to depose of huge mounds of coal tailings, the rejects from the coal mining process.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 18 Meeting of Rein with Creasor and a major potential European coal customer Simons. \\r\\nFeb. 18, 19 Meetings on the future of a new mine at Donkin-Morien.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb.28 Junior Achievement Cape Breton fund drive launch at the Holiday Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 3 First meeting with Skandia Inventuur, from Sweden, who wanted to sell DEVCO the rights to the production of Carbogel, a coal slurry that could be used as fuel. A basic coal water mixture fuel technology has emerged as one potential answer to uncertain fuel oil supply to the electricity generating industry during the past two decades. As is evident from numerous patents in the field, coal water mixture technology provides methods to manufacture fuels based on finely pulverized coal and water and wherein different chemicals are used to enhance both the solids concentration of the fuels and the pumpability and combustibility of such slurry fuels. Research will eventually refine transportability systems, use of specific gravity processes using chemical combinations to lower Sulphur and other pollutants content. Long-run projections believe that slurried coal will eventually be less expensive than less- accessible oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein also gave a speech to the Sydney Rotary Club regarding the Junior Achievement Cape Breton programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 18, 19 Evironment Canada delegation inspected the (old) Prince Mine and Preparation Plant with Rein representing DEVCO.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 27 Senior Executive Meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 2 Meeting with Rankin, Creasor, Verchuren, Rein reviewed the marketing and production scenarios presented in The Strategic Overview.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 14 One of DEVCO leased ships blew up at entrance to Rotterdam harbour. To reduce expenditures DEVCO was leasing older coal ships, commanded by inexperienced captains, who had never hauled coal, considered a dangerous material, full of explosive Methane gas. Because of a coal shortage on the world coal market, we had sold all our backlog coal stocks, which usually sat in open air for many months, while Methane gas escaped from the coal piles through aeration.  Lately we had been loading fresh coal from the mines, directly into the ship holds. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo save money the shipping company had hired a crew of natives from the Micronesian country of Kiripati. These men signed 12 month contracts which bound them to never leaving the ship and they knew nothing about hauling dangerous materials. One of them had decided to weld all the hatches closed on the deck of the ship, to prevent the coal from absorbing too much moisture. Delivered moisture content was critical to the buyer and was carefully specified in all contracts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ship approached the entrance to Rotterdam harbour, one of the Kiribatians took a torch to unweld one of the closed hatches. The Methane had spread throughout the hull \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we now had, in effect, a floating bomb. There was a big explosion that killed 4 of the Kiribatians.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a meeting of Rankin, Shield, Creasor, McKinnon and Rein, a very upset Rankin screamed at Rein saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy are you killing innocent people!!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein was flabbergasted, having just found out about the terrible accident himself. Rein was responsible for loading the coal into ships and delivering the coal to customers. After several more exchanges, Rankin roared at Rein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou will stop killing people immediately!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Henceworth, we were very careful in hiring knowledgeable captains and newer ships to transport our coal. Rein never learned, afterward, what had happened in Ottawa regarding the various legal suits involved. Operationally Lloyd Creasor continued to manage the hiring of ships. Subsequently, Rein paid a visit to most ship captains that docked at the Whitney Pier (sometimes with Michael in hand).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geography of Whitney Pier residential neighbourhood was defined by its relationship to the heavy industry of\\xc2\\xa0coal mining\\xc2\\xa0and steel manufacturing. The International Shipping Pier was located at the southern edge of the residential neighbourhood, adjacent to the steel plant property and the coal being hauled by the\\xc2\\xa0Sydney Coal Railway. The Sysco Steel Mill and DEVCO coal mines in the area, known as\\xc2\\xa0Industrial Cape Breton,\\xc2\\xa0were closed by November 2001, ignominiously forcing the local power plant to rely on coal imports. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe coke ovens had produced coke for the steel mill\\'s oxygen blast furnaces 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for almost 90 years. The resulting run off of contaminants from the coke production, as well as general contaminants from the steel mill itself and the loading of coal into ships, drained into Muggah Creek, a tidal estuary that geographically separated the steel mill and Whitney Pier from Sydney\\'s central business district.\\r\\nAfter several decades of environmental reviews and scientific studies, the federal and provincial governments undertook a $400 million cleanup of the site which will see the industrial contaminants in the estuary sealed in cement. Many poor residents of Whitney Pier have died from the environmental contaminants polluting the air they breathed in their homes.\\r\\nSeveral years after Rein left CBDC, Derek Rance, a fellow classmate from MBA 1963 days, became President and CEO from 1984 to 1987. Derek, well known for specializing in the area of performance improvement, tried very hard to turn around the performance at CBDC. He also fought a losing battle on behalf of the residents of Whitney Pier and was eventually fired.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 14 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 16 Rein was in Ottawa for Meetings with Treasury Board and MSED.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 27 - 29 Board Meeting at the NRC in Ottawa and various DREE and ITC meetings with bureaucrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 26 -28 In Halifax, with Rankin at price negotiations with NSPC. Rein asked to be paid the same price for coal that CBDC gets from international sales. Major uproar followed and meeting was recessed. Apparently politicians, behind the scenes, needed to be negotiating and discussing what to do. Discussions took place by the telephone with CBDC and Ottawa. Some sort of political agreement was negotiated with Rankin. Ottawa promised that coal should be sold at $42.50 per Ton to NSPC. This was seen as subsidy from Ottawa to Nova Scotia. CBDC supposedly was recompensed for the difference in its annual budget. Politics about which Rein was interviewed on ATV, Rein said nothing. But Rein was able to get into the minutes the current market price paid to CBDC in international markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 1 -3 Rein flew to Huston for workshops on corporate planning in the resource industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 22 -24 Senior Executive Group Workshops at Keltic Lodge on Northern Cape Breton Island. Final discussions were held on CBDC corporate plan prepared by Rein and Annette Verschuren.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 29 Meetings about Selco, a British Company that wanted to buy our tailings and to process coal from the rock waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 16 Vacation for Mari, Rein and family in a rented recreation vechicle, we did a circumnavigation of the Province of Nova Scotia. A wonderful memory remains of a Scottish Bag Pipe Player standing erect in the mist of a 6 am morning, waking us while we were sleeping in our RV.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 20 CBDC Strategic Overview submission was due at DREE, Ottawa.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 23 Dezso, Mona and children arrive for a visit and sailing on Lake Bras D\\xe2\\x80\\x99Or.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 28 Board Meetings of the Great Lakes Waterways Association in Ottawa.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 10 Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father was admitted to Montreal General Hospital. Rein kept in touch with father by telephone and through Jaan, his stepbrother, who lived in Montreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sept. 7 Mike flew proudly to Toronto by himself and back.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 17 Rein gave speech to Junior Achievement Cape Breton Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 6 Selco contract negotiations were held in Board Room, with Doug Shield, VP of Coal Mining, Lloyd Creasor and John Campbell (metallurgist) and others representing DEVCO. Around 1400 on October 5, Rein went to the urinal and Rankin entered suddenly and asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you in on the Selco negotiations and negotiating on our part.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rein replied that he had not been asked to head up the negotiations. Rankin asked Shield to turn the negotiations over to Rein. When, Donna, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive secretary, and Annette, heard about this, they rushed to the Board Room and Donna slipped a note to Rein. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ask for a recess, so we can update and coach you on the negotiations\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Rein was always very well looked after by his support staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Rein had been updated, he approached the Selco VP and negotiator, Richard Commette, privately, and asked him whether he really wanted to agree to a deal. Commette said that a lot of time had been wasted by the CBDC lawyers (government employees) and the various company analysts, asking about details and conditional clauses. It was not clear why these people had been asked to sit in on the negotiations. Commette and Rein agreed to henceforth control the negotiations and minimize these interruptions. That evening Commette and Rein had dinner and agreed to the major details of the agreement. These were turned over to the lawyers next morning and the negotiations continued on the afternoon of October 6. A tentative agreement was reached. \\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 8 The labour unions agreed to a strike, after an 85% yes-vote of their membership (in 11 separate unions). Rankin blamed Rein, in part, because Rein had been spreading the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood news\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that CBDC  could be viable and decade break-even in cash flow and by 2007 (when the price of coal would reach C$100). CBDC would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternationally competitive and financially viable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We avoided the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofitable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because we feared the socialist unions would strike. The positive message was intended for the local politicians and those in Ottawa, who had for some 20 years funded the CBDC deficit, unhappily and reluctantly, since the company had become a Crown Corporation, after it had gone bankcrupt as a private entity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe media, radio, TV and newspapers liked to interview Rein about such a positive message. But the union members apparently decided that they wanted an increase in wages and working conditions, immediately, if the company was going to survive competitively and financially viably. The message from Rein about the rosy future was too hard for union members to digest and perhaps too abstract to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nRankin made Rein face the union members, lead by Ray Holland, president, during public demonstrations. Actually Rein and Ray Holland (also the lead tenor of the popular \\xe2\\x80\\x98Men-of-the-Deeps\\xe2\\x80\\x99vocal chorus) were on good personal terms and lived in the same part of Sydney. Holland would often be standing on the flatbed of a truck, haranguing the corporation (and therby the Ottawa government). Rein was expected to reply and answer questions. All this was for the benefit of the TV, newspaper and Radio media. Holland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff would take photographs and send them to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff would take pictures of Holland on the flatbed truck and send them to his office. Rein figured, that, as long as the exchange of photographs continued there would be hope of an aimicable settlement. Bruce McDade, the corporate secretary and a lawyer, was directly involved, with Rankin, in the actual negotiations in the back Board Room. In fact, the corporation had been expecting a strike. At worst, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions had ignited it. Now he was serving the local needs to bitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 14 Carbogel briefing of Rein was held prior to him going to Sweden to negotiate a liscensing agreement. Supper with Senior Executive Group Meeting took place.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 16 In Halifax, Rein and Commette, of Selco, signed the contract they had negotiated. They also had supper to celebrate. Rein said enthusiastically to Commette, \\xe2\\x80\\x98That is the way to negotiate, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you agree!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Commette, a more experienced negotiator than Rein, replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Our agreement is only as good as the two people, in the future, who will manage the detailsof our contract.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He also advised, Rein, to always have at least two people from your side present at any negotiating session. This gives you time to think, plus an ally with whom to compare perceptions. Rein should always try to get the other party to name its bid price, first. Never bid against yourself he advised. Only raise your bid to top a real counter bid, not an imaginary one. This advice served Rein well in Sweden.\\r\\n\\r\\n Our agreements were approved by our respective Boards.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein flew in the evening to Fredricton to support Lloyd Creasor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negotiations with Nova Scotia Power Corporation. The price was actually still governed by the political agreement between the governments in Halifax and Ottawa. All we could determine was the quality of the coal shipped and the timing of the Railway Company deliveries.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 21 Rein went with Mari to Ottawa to attend the International Small Business Congress and to present an academic paper. \\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 28 Discussions were held with Rankin and Creasor about pricing on sales of CBDC coal to Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 30 Discussions held with Coal Mining Division, Doug Shield and managers reporting to him, about Greg McQuarrie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s design of new MIS systems for mine and other managers. Doug Shield was of the opinion that all he needed to know, early each morning, was \\xe2\\x80\\x98how much coal had been won on the night shift.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Apparently, each morning, at that time, Shield called up each of the 4 mine managers to find out how much coal had been won and if there were any problems. Long discussions ensued, and an attempt was made by Rein, McQuarrie and Annette to convince them that they needed more managerial information from the new MIS system. Our success was limited by their old fashioned practices.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo v. 2 Rein accompanied Mari to a Shadow Concil Meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 7 Mike and Dad went bowling. Rein tried to be involved with family life as much as possible during his busy schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 10 Rein met Ed Miskiman, President of Junior Achievement of Canada. Every effort was made to make Cape Breton JA as visible in Canada as possible. Cape Breton was often viewed as being way out there, somewhere, on the Eastern edge of Canada. In fact, Cape Breton JA had become more noticeable after winning more than its proportion of prizes. The JA kids were just marvelous and very motivated. The whole Island of Cape Breton was very enthusiastically supportive of the Island JA teams and turned out en masse to Mayflower Mall to buy trinkets made by the JA teams, once a year, while JA celebrations were. We took over all of the display places in the halls of the Mall each year. It was a big show of  JA students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 success.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 14 - 15 Rein and Colin Campbell, DEVCO metallurgist, flew Sydney-Halifax-Toronto-Frankfurt-Stockholm.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 16 Next day we flew to Lulea in Northern Sweden, where a Steel Mill was a customer of CBDC. After discussing the advantages of CBDC coal and understanding their needs, we rented a car and started our drive southward. We drove on E4, a coastal highway, that was covered with ice and snow and visited Skelleftea, where Mona Horvath\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother lived. Eventually we headed NW off on E4, to Boliden, a small town of approximately 2,000 people. It was the location of a large gold mine owned by The Boliden Corporation, one of the largest corporations in Sweden. Boliden Mineral Corporation extracted metals. The company smelted, milled, recycled and explored for minerals including zinc, lead, gold and silver. It was also the owner of a small subsidiary called Skandia Inventuur, a company that had developed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCarbogel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a coal slurry, that, reportedly, burned like oil. We were to meet a Senior Vice-President of Boliden and then continue on to Helsingborg, in the south of Sweden, the location of Scandia Inventuur research facilities. We were to observe a demonstration burning of Carbogel and complete negotiations for a possible CBDC liscence for North America would take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoliden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roads were sheer ice and residents were travelling around on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpush-sleds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d --- a wooden seat on ski tracks, that stretched out, so that a person could stand on them, from behind, and propel and steer the \\r\\npush-sled. It was a bit surreal, but we had to stop the car and proceed via a push-sled to reach the office.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the board room we met the Senior Vice-President, the President of Skandia Inventuur and a Mr. Matheson, a metallurgist and Vice-President of Skandia, who turned out be an Estonian. After some food, the VP of Boliden wanted to start negotiations, immediately. He was very over-bearing and obviously full of himself as a representative of a big corporation. He was condescending to us as the representatives of CBDC (only a small coal mining company). He was trying to give us \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe bum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rush\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by implying that Boliden was doing us some sort of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavour\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and that we should accept his price.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein replied to him by saying that we represented the government of Canada. We wanted to see a demonstration of Carbogel before deciding. Rein suggested a recess to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnegotiation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, until we met again in Helsingborg, the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Helsingborg, Skandia-Inventuur had set up a Carbogel burning demonstration, out in their yard. Rein told Colin, that since he was a metallurgist, he should watch what was going to happen very carefully. Rein would depend totally on his opinion. As the demonstration started, Rein noticed that Skandia technicians were having trouble starting to fire up the slurry. Apparently, they then poured something into the Carbogel to start the fire. Rein challenged their metallurgist, Matheson, as to what was going on. After some discussion between the two metallurgists, it was agreed that some more development of the Carbogel system was needed, but negotiations could proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon, at the hotel we were staying, the Senior VP of Boliden, once again tried to bully Rein into a quick agreement. No progress was made by him. That evening, after supper, we gathered for some cocktails. The Senior VP was drinking heavily and continued loudly bullying Rein to sign the agreement. Rein was very careful in limiting his alcohol intake. Eventually, a delirious Sr. VP, staggered backwards, and fell on a coffee table and broke it in two. He had passed out and was dragged out of the room, to his bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, when we gathered for negotiations, the Sr. VP had been replaced by another Boliden executive. We discussed several clauses in the agreement and, of course the price. Skandia-Inventuur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s President was very anxious to get an agreement on price and kept lowering his price. No agreement was reached. That evening Rein had a quiet talk with Matheson in Estonian. Matheson, somewhat beggingly, said that he would have trouble carrying out the research remaining to be done on Carbogel, below a price which he named. We were the first customers who were interested in Carbogel and he agreed that we deserved to garner a reasonable price. Rein decided to believe him. \\r\\n\\r\\nNext day we met again. The President of Skandia opened the negotiations by quoting a very low price. Rein replied with a higher price (the same that had been quoted by Matheson to him privately). The Boliden executive lost his cool. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot go backwards by raising your price. It is just never done this way!!!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We signed the contract and flew back to Sydney via Copenhagen. Skandia-Inventuur agreed to come to meet us in Sydney, when they had completed their research, that still remained to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 2 Last Senior Executive Meeting of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 3 Meeting was held about Scotia Liquidfuel with Petsky, Annette, McClean, Campbell.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 To keep in contact Reein held meetings in Toronto with CFIB, COSB and Horvath. Rein also visited the farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 13 Mari and Rein delivered the Christmas service, at St. Andrews one of the largest churches i9n Sydney. We spoke from 2 pulpits, intermittently. All of the service had been written by Mari, with periodic involvement of young children.The huge church was full and Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s script involving local children worked magnificently. Rein was reprimanded by Mari for hogging the show with his deep voice. Quilty, Rein tried to make amends.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 15 - 17 Meetings with Carbogel people from Sweden, who were in town to see also Roy McClean and D.S. Rankin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 17 Rein delivered luncheon address to the Kiwanis Club, followed immediately by Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school play.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 18 Senior Executive briefing was held regarding the new CBDC MIS System.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 20 Christmas party for Junior Achievement Cape Breton staff and Board took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 January 4 Christmas Holidays were celebrated in our Sydney home. Mari again was in charge of the choreography. A huge snow storm had dropped snow up to the eaves of the roof of the house. Rein and Mike built a lot of snowmen and slides and tunnels. Mike jumped down from the roof of the house, onto the top of our car and collapsed the roof, which was subsequently fixable.\\r\\n\\r\\n 1982 \\r\\nFalkland Islands Invaded by Argentina \\r\\nKing Henry VIII\\'s Ship the Mary Rose Raised After 437 Years \\r\\nVietnam War Memorial Opened in Washington, DC \\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 4 - 8 Rein working on Corporate Plan/Strategic Overview with Skerrett to fine tune the Financial model.

Rein asked a personal Estonian friend and doctor, Dr. Enn Jomm to visit Romulus, his father, and to get him released if possible. Rein also asked him to reduce the long list of medications (that had apparently been progressively, unnecessarily, expanded by visiting student interns) reduced by 50%, if at all possible. Subsequently, thank the Lord, Dr. Jomm was able to do exactly all that. Romulus stopped feeling sorry for himself. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relations with his father were subsequently restored. Jaan Kiis, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s step-brother had been mostly looking after Romulus, alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 7 Rein took Via Rail to Kingston and drove thence to the farm. He met with Rorabeck, who agreed to sever one acre and the old house in Kenny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name.

Rein would rush up to the school to rescue Mike periodically. One time Mike was trapped in the lobby of an apartment house by bullies. Rein spoke to the principal about the bullying and met with one parent, who turned out to be Hungarian, her husband worked for DEVCO. That stopped the bullying.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 Capital Projections for Senior Executive Meeting, To Halifax for Atlamtic Canada Plus meetings and dinner, Local Federal MPs make political announcement about Carbogel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mihkel Matheson and his boss from Skandia Inventuur from Sweden present, Publicising CB-JA in Port Hawkesbury and Cheticamp (On Northside of Cape Breton Island). \\r\\n\\r\\nCB-JA students and staff organized a Farewell Party on a big experimental sailboat built on a concrete hull. Afterwards in the Royal Cape Breton Yacht Club there was a party, with speeches and the students sang a song they had written about Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement in Junior Achievement on Cape Breton. A tearful goodbye was said to everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peterson family returned to Toronto. Rein started to teach again at the Schulich School of Business. Sailing had become a real passion for Rein. He raced three times a week at the Royal Canadian Yacht Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand what the attraction was of \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisking one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a stormy, cold, and wet night out on the lake. In Greek history, as recorded in the Iliad and the Odyssey, Homer celebrated the excitement of battle, the joy comradeship, and the glory of the aristeia, when a warrior lost himself in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvictorious rampage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and became an irresistible force, sweeping all before him. In the heightened state of aristeia the hero experienced a superabundance of life that flared up gloriously in contempt of death. Most of the characters in Homer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s works were men. So, Rein supposed that this was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cman sort of thing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The glory of having done battle with a storm in the middle of the night, extending one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skill and courage to the limit, and surviving, to live another day, was kind of macho aristeia.\\r\\nMaybe this was a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equivalent of women, risking their life, going through the trauma, and the pain of giving birth to a child. It makes them probably feel more like a woman. Oh well, whatever may be the case, it may at least be just an afterthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1983\\r\\nReagan Announces Defense Plan Called Star Wars \\r\\nSally Ride Becomes the First American Woman in Space \\r\\nSoviets Shoot Down a Korean Airliner \\r\\nU.S. Embassy in Beirut Bombed \\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 2 Roy and Delores MacLean from Cape Breton visited Mari and Rein in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 18 Bill Menzel former Senior Vice President of Shell Canada, who had become a friend, discussed doing research on Shell Alsands.

Rein was appointed as the chairholder. This was one of the first business administration academic chairs in Canada. Two Post Doctoral Fellows from Sweden came to do research on Entrepreneurship funded by the Chair (Bengt Johannisson, Leif Melin).\\r\\nFrank Stronach wanted Rein to write a book about his life and success.\\r\\nHe said he had founded a new management system. In 1971, Stronach introduced his management philosophy to the corporation. Called FAIR ENTERPRISE, it was based on a business Charter of Rights which gave investors, employees, and management the right to share in the profits that they helped to produce. These rights were enshrined in a governing Corporate Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein spent time following Stronach and his President Manfred Gingl to meetings and watched them operate. One of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PhD students was placed to work on an assembly line for 6 months, making pulleys. Alex Stewart was an anthropologist and wrote a dissertation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Bigman Metaphor for Entrepreneurship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRein observed negotiations with subcontractors. It seemed that subcontractors were small companies owned by European craftsmen, with no management experience. They would agree to a 50-50 partnership. But were not able to participate in the rapid growth of Magna and would have to sell their part of the ownership gradually and lose control of their technology. Admittedly they became rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlant level management meetings seemed to be quite rough, with Stronach and Gingl using their toolmaker expertise to dominate discussions. For example, Stronach wanted a complete unit system of circulation designed so that Magna could expand their business. When there was resistance, Gingl went outside, we could see this through a window, he opened the hood of his car and ripped out the existing system and brought it to the discussion table. A complete unitary system was eventually designed, built, and sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein declined to write the book, Fair Enterprise. A journalist eventually wrote such a book. Rein felt that the story was much more complex and evolved around tool-making expertise and the Fair Enterprise System was a part of Frank Stronach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s socialist belief system. His father in Austria had been a Communist. Magna was a very impressive operation.\\r\\nMay 30 Rein, Sharwood and Gallagher had first meeting at 0730 at Fran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Restaurant about establishing the Canadian Association of Family Enterprise (CAF\\xc3\\x89).\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 22 Rein flew to Sudbury for a Speech to Canadian Mining Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 24 - 28 Rein flew to Montreal for Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 75-th birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 18 Rein and Crowston to Ottawa for meeting with Campeau who said he was interested in funding a Chair.\\r\\nJuly 25 Rein passed Intermediate Cruise sailing skipper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exam at Kingston on the 26 foot \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMorning Mist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 29 Mari and Rein went on trip: Toronto-Signapore-Kuala Lumpur- Bangkok-Signapore-Honolulu-Toronto. \\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 25 Joe Clark at Faculty of Administrative Studies for PhD Seminar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 23 Steering Committee meeting was held at Toronto Club to establish Canadian Association of Family Enterprise. Rein, with the help of Mari, was elected VP of publications. Canadian Association of Family Enterprise now has chapters from coast to coast in Canada and over 1000 family members.\\r\\n\\r\\n1984 \\r\\nHuge Poison Gas Leak in Bhopal, India \\r\\nIndira Gandhi, India\\'s Prime Minister, Murdered by Two Bodyguards\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfearful year\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1984 had come and gone, but George Orwell\\'s prophetic, nightmarish vision written in 1949 of what the world was becoming  possible and timelier than ever.\\xc2\\xa0We all treaded the coming of a dictatorial world that would even control our thought processes. Truth could be dictated by superior powers from a Ministry of Truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n1984\\xc2\\xa0was still the great modern classic of a book about \"negative utopia\" \\r\\n--  a startlingly original and haunting novel that created an imaginary world that was completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one could deny the novel\\'s hold on the imaginations of a whole generation, or the power of its admonitions -- a power that seems to have grown, not lessened, with the passage of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrwell was right. But it seems that he was somewhat off on his timing -- like most predictions of our future. Rein hopes that we will continue to enjoy the freedom of being ourselves in a democratic society, proving also George Orwell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all future predictions wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari and Rein bought a 30 foot Alberg sailboat that had been used by a family, who had been living aboard, at the Frenchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bay Marina. She was called ANTARES and we eventually christened her as Antares Lennuk. Lennuk was the boat of the Estonian mythological hero, Kalevipoeg. Lennuk\\xc2\\xa0was sailed by Kalevipoeg to locate the end of the world. His boat was built entirely of silver. Lennuk (flyer) was chosen as a name so the boat could sail so that it could fly over rough waves. For Mari and Rein Antares Lennuk meant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStar Flyer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Mari and Rein also promised to sail their sailboat to the ends of the earth, together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agua-marine colored boat had the following specifications:\\r\\n\\tL.O.A. 30 Ft. 3 Inches.\\t\\tBallast 3,300 lbs.\\r\\n\\tL.W.L. 21 Ft. 8 Inches.\\t\\tDisplacement 9,000 lbs.\\r\\n\\tBeam 8 Ft. 9 Inches.\\t\\tWorking Canvas 410 Sq.

Rein worked with eight PhD candidates that participated in the workshop.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 28 CAF\\xc3\\x89 Board Meeting at Toronto Club, followed by the Programme Committee meeting that organized the first educational programmmes for the members.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 24 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 27 Rein went to Alberta Business School in Edmonton to conduct workshops. They were interested in recruiting Rein. In Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion Edmonton was a bit too far up North and out of the general flow of business activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2- 3 Rein and family invited to Alpine Ski Club for weekend in Collingwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was directing 8 MBA strategy research projects (MGMT 6010) with regular weekly meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was electedThe Paul T. Babson Professor at Babson College, Boston after a research paper competition held at The Wharton School of Finance in Philadelphia. This was the most respected visitor research chair position in the world. Rein had been recommended by one of his mentors, Prof. Albert Shapiro, before he had recently died. Shapero at the time was the most recognized researcher and philosopher in the emerging field of academic entrepreneurship. At the Philadelphia meeting Rein had presented a theoretical construct that linked all the aspects of entrepreneurship research together for the first time.Shapero had liked the research work Rein had been doing and so did the panel of senior professors who sat together in the back of the lecture hall, as evaluators.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreement with vice-President Copen was that Rein would officially start in September, 1986 for two terms. Rein continued to simultaneously hold the Magna International Chair in Entrepreneurial Studies at FAS. Instead of salary Rein opted for for an unlimited epense budget. This would allow him to commute to Toronto weekly by airplane or by personal automobile, with the mileage paid for. He had a personal secretary. He was given the use of a two bedroom house on the campus. Food could be bought at a store or Rein could eat at a very upscale cafeteria with the executive development programme senior managers. All of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research expenses were paid and he had unlimited time to use the College main computer system, with assistance when needed. Mari, Rein, Michael and Jenny, with dog Scruffy, were allowed to visit as often as they wished.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Rein was in Boston for Babson Research Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 10 Rein appeared in the taping of TVO shows to be broadcast as a course on small business and entrepreneurship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 15 CAF\\xc3\\x89 Compensation Forum held at Skyline Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 29 Conference Board seminar held on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaking Innovation Work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at Westin Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 June 1 Rein attended Meetings of ICSB in Halifax.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 11 Rein at Babson College, Boston for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrice-Babson Fellows Programme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Rein at Universite de Montreal ICSB Research Conference to present paper called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Moral and Instrumental Aspects of Personal Networks of Entrepreneurss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with Alex Stewart, PhD student.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 27, 28 Research Meetings took place with Visiting Research Fellow from Arhus, Sweden, Bengt Johannisson and Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 28 Michael went to Wanapitae Camp to earn canoeing qualification as Voyageur.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10 Rein rented a 40 foot Niagara sail boat, called Tahiti, for cruise to Niagara on the Lake, to The Shaw Festival to see \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn Bell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Other Island\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. There was one other sailor from York University to help Rein as skipper. Passangers were Mari and our neighbours the Fedchuns and two friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we left Toronto there were dark clouds on the horizon. Rein suggested that we wait for the storm to pass. Everybody else was very gung-ho, to go! We left late in the afternoon and in the middle of Lake Ontario the remnants of the Streetsville Tornado hit us. Rein lowered all the sails and headed into the wind. Everyone else went down below deck. After 2 hours we were blown to the US, South shore of Lake Ontario. The windage on our large hull made us sail backwards. We eventually were able strike our sails again and several hours later reached our destination. Rein was able to raft as the fifth boat off shore and we all hurried to the theatre. This must have been Shaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most boring ancient politics show. We all fell asleep in our seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe slept on the boat and enjoyed ourselves at a local restaurant. Next day we sailed for Toronto, using the CN Tower as the biggest buoy in the world. No navigation was reguired. Although we had to dodge large laker coats that probably couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see us on their radar. Some people on board wanted to insist that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe had the right of way\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, here and there. Rein explained that size is might you do not want to fool with on water.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 14 More TV performance sessions were reguired at TVO for their special broadcast course on entrepreneurship, involving Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 15 Jenny went to French language day camp. This was the beginning of Jenny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mastery of several languages, which were clearly her talent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 18 -22 Rein in Montreal to see Romulus, Jaan and Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 28 Jenny and Rein attended the performance of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeven Brides for Seven Brothers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Royal Alex Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 8 The 25-th anniversary of York University.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 8 Institute for Canadian \\xe2\\x80\\x93 American Studies was held at University of Windsor. Rein presented a paper.                                                                            \\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 9 Canadian racing boat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue North\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was at Metro Convention Centre. Rein and Mari were one of the sponsors of its racing.  True North 1\\xc2\\xa0was designed by Steve Killing, one of the principal designers at C&C Yachts from 1972 until 1979. True North 1\\xc2\\xa0was designed as a longer, heavier boat - specifically built to withstand everything that Fremantle, Australia could throw at it.  Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron was the club-of-record for the\\xc2\\xa0True North\\xc2\\xa0America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cup challenge in 1984.\\xc2\\xa0  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLength overall 13.64 Metres (44.5 Feet)\\r\\nBeam 3.79 Meters (12.4 Feet)\\r\\nDraft 2.67 Meters (8.8 Feet)\\r\\nSail 167 Sq. Meters (1797.6 Sq. Feet)\\r\\n\\r\\n12 Metre sail boats are so called NOT because of their overall length, but because they must conform to a formula. The formula takes into consideration various measurements of the the vessel and the result must not exceed 12 metres. In fact these sailboats can be 70 feet long with 86 foot masts and weigh in at approximately thirty-five tons.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, the wing-keeled Australia II was the state-of-the-art 12 Metre Class. Australia II\\xc2\\xa0(KA 6) was an Australian\\xc2\\xa012-metre-class\\xc2\\xa0America\\'s Cup\\xc2\\xa0challenge\\xc2\\xa0racing yacht\\xc2\\xa0that was launched in 1982\\xc2\\xa0and won the\\xc2\\xa01983 America\\'s Cup\\xc2\\xa0for the\\xc2\\xa0Royal Perth Yacht Club. Skippered by\\xc2\\xa0John Bertrand, she was the first successful Cup challenger, ending a132-year tenure (with 26 successful defences) by the\\xc2\\xa0New York Yacht Club. New York Yacht Club tried to challenge the legality of the design, unsuccessfully. The winged-keel has become the standard for all racing boats all over the world, including the RCYC boat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPagan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on which Rein raced.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue North 1 was built by Crockett-McConnel in 1985 and she sailed in the 12 Metre World Championships in 1986, the year before the America\\'s Cup contest. It was modified several times and ended up as a charter boat, teaching sailing to tourists at Sin Marteen Island in the Carribean.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 12 Rein and Howard Stevenson taught the DBA students workshop at Harvard Business School. Rein tried to emphasize that DBA candidates read carefully who the subjects of any research study are. For example, D. C. McClelland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjects were all from IBM managers from around the world. For example, Rein made the students say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccording to a large study of IBM managers\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9caccording to research by D.C. McClelland there are 3 needs for individual entrepreneur managers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The latter description is an overstatement of McClelland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 12 JA Semi Annual Meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 16 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Mari and Rein travelled to Amsterdam for the Congress of SMEs Meeting, where Rein presented his research findings after analyzing a 4400 interview data bank. Rein had concluded that the 4400 data points were a poor research data base because there had not been sufficient control on data collection. Each of the 12 countries collected data that they were interested in and it ranged from economic development bureaucrats to venture capitalists. Rein presented a paper that explained in detail the data collection mistakes that were involved in the 4400 data base. This of course caused some controversy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editor-in-chief of the best entrepreneurship journal, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEntrepreneurship Theory and Practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d invited Rein to prepare a paper for publication. Rein never got around to doing this. He had said what he had to say and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interested in playing the publication for publication\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake game. Rein regrets this. It could have become the most quoted paper on experimental practice in the field and would have been the major output of the Paul T. Babson Chair that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then it has occurred to Rein that he also missed an opportunity to directly compare the findings of the 12 disparate data sources or between some smaller groups of countries.

Rein founded the Centre for International Entrepreneurship by inviting, for the first time in history, European academics to a special academic conference on the need to develop and expand knowledge about international academic entrepreneurship. There was some controversy, among US academics, at the time, that only the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmericans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were natural entrepreneurs, because of their cultural makeup. Subsequently, international entrepreneurship became a part of the popular annual \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBabson College Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research Conference\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein was an editor of the 1986, Sixth Annual \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrontiers of Entrepreneurship Research\\xe2\\x80\\x9d publication (736 pages of selected, only refereed papers presented). \\r\\n\\r\\nRein was also Co-editor, Frontiers of international Entrepreneurship Research and published a monograph, Encouraging Entrepreneurship Internationally, based on the proceedings of the First Research Conference on International Entrepreneurship organized and chaired by the Paul T. Babson Professorship.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Feb. 3 Mari joined Rein at Babson College.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 27 & Feb. 3 HBS DBA student Seminars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 7 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 8 Rein in Washington, D.C. for ICSB Management Committee Meetings.\\r\\nFeb. 13, 14 Rein held meetings with Daniel Musyka, a DBA candidate at HBS. Rein served as one of his advisors. Daniel was appointed, during his successful career, as the President and Chief Executive Officer of\\xc2\\xa0The Conference Board of Canada and Vice-President and Chair of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada in December, 2014. Previously he had been the Dean and the RBC Financial Group Professor of Entrepreneurship at the University of British Columbia\\'s\\xc2\\xa0Sauder School of Business. Rein had vouched for him as one of his recommenders.\\r\\nFeb. 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93Mar.2 Rein and Mari went to Kingston, Jamaica to help with the establishment of the Jamaican Institute of Management. Rein met with several governement officials and organized an Economic Developement Conference and Workshops, which ultimately recommended an Economic Strategy for Jamaica. Dezso Horvath was one of the speakers. Rein was also invited to garden parties held by the two political parties on the Island. Both parties had thugs with visible guns protecting the people from a possible attack by the opposite party members. Apparently this was not an uncommon ocurrence. Yikes!\\r\\nAll went well until Clive Hobson the Executive Director of JIM, living in the posh Beverly Hills part of Kingston, suffered a terrible loss. His young daughter drowned in the family outdoor swimming pool. Clive resigned and became deeply depressed. There was no successor for his leadership and the initiative for JIM literally disappeared.\\r\\nMarch 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 6 Rein was at Babson College.\\r\\nMarch 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 18 Rein and Family visited Norman Smith at Eugene, Oregon and went skiing at Bend. Rein and Norman were working on research paper about the differences between Craftsman and Opportunistic entrepreneurs which was published in Frontiers of Entrepreneurshp Reseach, Babson College.\\r\\nMarch 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 28 Rein was at Babson College. Robert Ronstadt and Rein submitted a paper to the Harvard Business Review called, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeveloping Your Entrepreneurial KnowWho\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a discussion of Entreprenuerial Personal Networks. Just before publication, the Associate Editor who had approved our paper was fired. Ronstadt tried to find another editor but failed.  A booklet was subsequently published by Lord Publishing and a Working Paper was issued by NCMRD.\\r\\nApril 1 Rein in New York City with William R. Dill, President of Babson College to carry out some publicity at the Hill-Knowlton agency and New York Times.\\r\\nApril 3 Mari joins Rein who appeared on WKOX, Dr. Scott Borelli Radio Show, in Farmingham, Mass.\\r\\nApril 4 Rein was at Babson College preparing for the first meeting of the Centre of International Entrepreneurship Development.\\r\\nApril 14 - 15 Meetings of the Centre for International Entrepreneurship a toral of 300 researchers showed up from all over the world, including Bengt Johannisson and Leif Melin from Sweden.\\r\\nApril 16 Meetings of The Babson College Founders Day were held, honouring famous entrepreneurs. Rein and Mari sat at the head table beside Mr. Godfried Christienson, Chairman of Interlego from Billund, Denmark. He talked about the founding of his Lego empire of children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toys manufacturing. Rein and Godried became friends and he invited Rein and Jenny to come to the Billund, the original Legoland Entertainment Park, which had opened on June 7, 1968. The park was located next to the original Lego factory. Billund was surprisingly Denmark\\'s second busiest airport. Godfried sent his private airplane to pick us up in Copenhagen and were his personal guests.\\r\\nApril 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 18 Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research Conference was held. Many of the attendees stayed over from the CIED Conference and there was close 500 researchers present at the premier entrepreneuship research conference in the world. It was an honour to be asked to present your research paper.\\r\\nMay 7 Mari and Rein returned to Toronto.\\r\\nMay 13 Rein returned to Boston.\\r\\nWhile at Babson, Rein challenged the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmericans are the best entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d belief at an executive development meeting held at the Harvard Business School, at the invitation of Prof. Howard Stevenson. \\r\\nAccording to the Danish author Aksel Sandemose, 1960, European, especially Scandinavian countries discourage people from promoting their own achievements over those of others. \\xc2\\xa0It is common in Scandinavia to claim that the Laws of Jante must always apply.  This is something quintessentially Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and the Netherlands.\\r\\nJante Laws formulate in words the unwritten laws that say what you cannot stand up and believe, that you are better than others. Which means that someone who has accomplished something should not expect to be recognized for it.This tends to be very contrary to the U.S. attitude, according to researchers like McClelland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ten JANTE rules state:\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0are anything special.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0are as good as\\xc2\\xa0we\\xc2\\xa0are.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0are smarter than\\xc2\\xa0we\\xc2\\xa0are.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to convince yourself that\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0are better than\\xc2\\xa0we\\xc2\\xa0are.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0know more than\\xc2\\xa0we\\xc2\\xa0do.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0are more important than\\xc2\\xa0we\\xc2\\xa0are.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0are good at anything.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to laugh at\\xc2\\xa0us.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think anyone cares about\\xc2\\xa0you.\\r\\nYou\\'re not to think\\xc2\\xa0you\\xc2\\xa0can teach\\xc2\\xa0us\\xc2\\xa0anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein believes that Janteloven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pernicious and nebulous nature reinforce the notion that underlying factors (such as class, education, age, etc.) are natural, and cannot be earned. This allows a powerful grouping of old money agents to oppress less powerful groups. By quoting Janteloven, such agents can conceal their own motives, and simultaneously conceal the source (or the lack of) of their power, whilst reinforcing it through a paradigm of enforced equality.\\r\\n  \\r\\nFor a Harvard Business School executive development course, Rein wore a black academic robe and quoted \\xe2\\x80\\x9creligiously\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from D. C. McClelland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s book, Achieving Society, on the value systems of US and European  managers. Rein read it as if he were a Priest, first from McClelland and then from the Charles Orth III monograph on what was reallyhappening in a HBS case discussion classroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcClelland argued that there were three managerial motivations: Need for Achievement, Need for Power and Need for Affiliation. Americans according to his research (with IBM managers world-wide) excelled in the Need for Achievement more than any other nation in the world. While Europeans, for example the Netherlands, excelled in the Need for Affiliation (similar to the Jante Laws). Therefore, according to McClelland, Americans were most likely to be entrepreneurs. This was indeed the prevailing belief among many American managers and professors, at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his second reading, Rein, as a Priest, read from the research of Harvard Prof. Charles Orth III, who had studied the cultural values of several Harvard Business School classrooms. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Charles D. Orth III, from his research paper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSocial Structure and Learning Climate: The First Year at the Harvard Business School (1963)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Section A insisted on coping norms unique to the section:\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dominate the discussion by talking too often or too long.\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t refute another man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point.\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring in knowledge from outside the classroom \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is unfair competition.\\r\\nYou should be conservative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9coff-beat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Rein these were clearly Janteloven at the Harvard Business School, in Section A!\\r\\n\\r\\nRein asked the executive course participants, does this mean that in the Harvard Business School slassroom, discussion had a strong penchant for a need for Affiliation (rather than entrepreneurship)? This caused many denying arguments and general turmoil. Rein eventually was able to escape from the defensive counter-arguments. He was subsequently criticized for wearing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPriest\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toga\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and embarrassing his audience by Prof. Stevenson.These were clearly defensive moves about what goes on in a Harvard Business School classroom and by implication among some potential American future managers. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the long run, during the time Rein was the Paul T. Babson Professor, at Babson College, he probably had some impact on this general US cultural value falsehood. Evidence being that U.S. and European professors at future Babson College research conferences presented many examples of very successful European entrepreneurs, implying that the importance of cultural background was more complex, than previously thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 21 Rein met with Sari Scheinberg, Howard Stevenson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research assistant and DBA candidate. She and Howard were convinced that they could analyze the 4400 interviews better than Rein had done. In the long run they also failed and quit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 24 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 May 28 Rein met with Lois Stevenson, from Acadia University, Nova Scotia. We were discussing doing joint research work on female entrepreurship, but we never published anything jointly. She was sponsored by the Babson Chair. Lois became active in government programmes in Ottawa and Halifax. She worked with international development organizations in the field of entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprise policy development.

All of the songs were in Estonian for the first time.The publisher Johann Voldemar Jannsen organized the Song Festival as part of the Estonian national awakening movement. The year 1869 marked the 50-th anniversary of the freeing, by the Russian Tsar, of the Estonian inured peasant slaves. Simple peasants discovered for the first time that their traditions could be part of high culture. Jannsen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, Lydia Koidula (nicknamed Lydia of the Dawn or Awakening), was the author of lyrics for two Estonian nationalistic songs, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSind surmani\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (You Until Death) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMu isamaa on minu arm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (My Fatherland is my Love), continue to be in the Estonian popular song repertoire today. The first Song festival sent a clear message to nations of the world that Estonia was European and not a voluntary part of Russian Tsarist hegemony.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938, at the eleventh\\xc2\\xa0Laulupidu,\\xc2\\xa0Gustav Ernesaks\\xc2\\xa0conducted the mass choirs for the first time, and his own music was performed. In 1944, he wrote the classic music for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMu isamaa on minu arm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, with the lyrics of Lydia Koidula, during his deportation to Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSong festivals eventually became the main anchor of Estonian identity. Several times the song celebrations have led to Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s independence. In the 19th century, the choirs and song celebrations were at the core of the national awakening of Estonian peasants, who discovered the value of their own language and cultural heritage through singing. The national awakening and establishment of identity led to Estonian independence in 1918. After WWII, during the Soviet repression, the song celebrations helped keep the national identity alive. In 1988, several hundred thousand people gathered at the Song Festival grounds and sang about desiring freedom for many days and nights. The massive turnout at the Singing Revolution (33% of the entire population) helped end Soviet rule and led to Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s independence once again in 1991. Most Estonians, today, believe that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin 1991we sang ourselves, once again, to FREEDOM !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe darkest chapter in the Song Celebration history occurred at the\\r\\nthirteenth\\xc2\\xa0Laulupidu. Soviet 1950 Stalinist era propaganda songs dominated the repertoire; choirs of Soviet miners and the Soviet army choir were among the participants. But, during the dark era of Soviet oppression, choir singing remained one of the few areas where private initiative and trust were still present. This helped keep the longing for freedom alive. In spite of the schizophrenic situation, most Estonians held the Song Celebration dear and as the most important recurring national event.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, at the thirteenth\\xc2\\xa0Laulupidu, Soviet propaganda songs dominated the repertoire; choirs of Soviet miners and the army choir were among the participants. During the dark era of Soviet oppression, choir singing remained one of the few areas where private initiative and trust were still present. This helped keep the longing for freedom alive. In spite of the schizophrenic situation, most Estonians held the Song Celebration dear and a most important national event.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the fifteenth festival, the new Song Festival stage, by the architect Alar Kotli,\\xc2\\xa0had been built. But before the concert, the very nationalistic song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMu isamaa on minu arm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (My fatherland is my love), was removed from the programme by the Soviet Estonian Government. However, the huge choirs, once they were gathered on the stage started to sing it spontaneously. After a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hesitation, the hero and artistic giant, Gustav Ernesaks (1908 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1993) climbed up to the conductor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stand and started to defiantly conduct the choirs. \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an electric moment in Estonian history. From the start he had played an integral role in the\\xc2\\xa0Singing Revolutions\\xc2\\xa0and was one of the grand leading figures of the\\xc2\\xa0Estonian Song Festival\\xc2\\xa0tradition. One of his songs, set to\\xc2\\xa0Lydia Koidula\\'s poem was\\xc2\\xa0Mu isamaa on minu arm, became an unofficial\\xc2\\xa0national anthem of Estonians during the years of\\xc2\\xa0Soviet occupation. Since then, the song has become the most anticipated and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompulsory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d finale of any singing celebration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 1944, a squadron of the Soviet air force (consisting of only females)\\r\\nbombed downtown Tallinn and destroyed the Estonia opera house, the \\r\\nnational broadcasting centre and the conservatory. The Soviet government was very proud of this event. But by September, 1944 more than 80,000 Estonians had fled the country to the West, among them many well-known musicians. Defiantly, once again, in 1946, a large refugee Estonian Song Festival was held in Geislingen, Germany; subsequently Festivals were also held in Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia and UK. Estonian culture was safe.\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1987 \\r\\nDNA First Used to Convict Criminals \\r\\nKlaus Barbie, the Nazi Butcher of Lyons, Sentenced to Life in Prison \\r\\nNew York Stock Exchange Suffers Huge Drop on \"Black Monday\" \\r\\nWest German private Pilot Landed Unchallenged in Moscow\\'s Red Square \\r\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union signed an agreement: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nStirrings for freedom from Soviet power became more evident.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy (including Estonia) was in a critical situation, largely caused by a lack of technological development compared to the West.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nMikhail Gorbachev was general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991 and president of the Soviet Union from 1990 to 1991. His social reforms known as Glasnost (\"openness\"), combined with economic reforms known as Perestroika (\"restructuring\"), helped liberalize Soviet society in the late 1980s and ultimately contributed to the downfall of communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Gorbachev was interviewed for the CNN COLD WAR series in September 1997. The excerpts below were translated from Russian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, one had to give (the Soviet) people an opportunity to feel the results of perestroika -- not only in the field of democracy, but also in the social field. We needed results. [But] I could feel the resistance inside the country; I could already feel it at the end of 1986 and the beginning of 1987. People were telling me, we support your policy, but you should know that nothing is changing here. The Nomenklatura -- [the old, bureaucratic establishment] -- continues to run things here, and your reforms do not to mean anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that the biggest miscalculation of the Soviet leadership was when we did what we did in 1968 against democratic reforms during the Prague Spring. That was their legitimate attempt to stay within Soviet reform, staying within the framework of democracy, and to transition to a mixed economy. But the Soviet-style system was imposed on those people. If all (our) countries had embarked on the road of reforming their societies and their economies, it could have led to different results: to liberalization, to changing over to the democratic rails of development, but that wasn\\'t done. Moreover, there was a strong ideological reaction from the hard-liners. They controlled the media, dissidents began to be sent to prison. The Soviet-style system was imposed on the people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told all the leaders of the Soviet Republics, you decide what reforms you need. We, in Russia, need perestroika. Whether you need perestroika is up to you. For example, we prompted Honecker, the leader of East Germany: Either you reform your country, or events will sweep you away. And that is what happened, eventually.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Soviet Union could have been preserved. No doubt there were a lot of ethnic problems in our multinational state; but those problems should have been solved on the basis of decentralization, not disintegration. And now, those who supported the collapse of the Soviet Union, those who wrote all those documents for Yeltsin, now say that Gorbachev\\'s \"Soft Union Treaty\" -- which didn\\'t happen because of the August coup, and was resubmitted in the Fall -- was better. Because when that treaty was dropped, the Republics started to distance themselves from the Soviet Union at different paces, the reforms started in different directions, and the whole development in the post-Soviet formation took a bad turn. The collapse of the Soviet system was an internal process, and this problem should have been solved -- but without ruining the Soviet Union.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 30, 1987 in Tallinn, an independent protest conference opened devoted to legal reassessment of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1940. The conference was attended by representatives from Byelorussia, East and West Germany, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldavia, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. The defiance of Soviet control was spreading. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn activist Estonian Group was started to reveal publicly the secrets of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Communists and Nazis, included a secret protocol that divided territories of\\xc2\\xa0Romania,\\xc2\\xa0Poland,\\xc2\\xa0Lithuania,\\xc2\\xa0Latvia,\\xc2\\xa0Estonia, and\\xc2\\xa0Finland\\xc2\\xa0into German and Soviet \"spheres of influence, anticipating potential territorial and political rearrangements\" of these countries after World War II.\\xc2\\xa0At an activist mass meeting in Hirvepark in Tallinn, people demanded that the secret protocol of the 1939 pact\\xc2\\xa0be made more public. The meeting was not forcefully disbanded, as would have happened before, which showed that civil rights had expanded and the regime had softened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the authorities even granted permission to hold the demonstration\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of Estonia had again begun protesting through their song festivals. The\\xc2\\xa0Singing Revolution\\xc2\\xa0is now a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of\\xc2\\xa0Estonia,\\xc2\\xa0The name was coined by an Estonian activist and artist,\\xc2\\xa0Heinz Valk, in an article published a week after the June 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9311, 1988, spontaneous mass night-singing demonstrations at the\\xc2\\xa0Tallinn Song Festival Grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Estonian Song Festivals also aroused Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dormant patriotism. Ivo Linna\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ensemble sang \"Five Patriotic Songs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on a video tape that was given to Rein. Alo Mattiisen was the composer. Linna sang his heart out. It was his moment in Estonian history. It also became Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very personal moment when he decided that he must become involved in the Estonian Freedom Movement and he subsequently did.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarl Vaino (1978 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1988) had been a fanatical true forceful implementor of Soviet policy in Estonia.  After the Breshnev Stagnation Era he tried to turn Estonians into Russian speaking persons (Venestamine). Everything,   Language, Culture, Schools, even kindergarten children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s programmes were forcefully being imbedded with Russian values and rules.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1988\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summer 1988, under public pressure and in order to avoid a popular movement getting out of control, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev replaced\\xc2\\xa0Karl Vaino, the ultra-conservative head of the Estonian Communist Party, who was extremely unpopular among the Estonians. The new leadership was changed to Estonian\\xc2\\xa0Vaino V\\xc3\\xa4ljas  (June 17, 1988). He was Gorbachev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school classmate and friend. Valjas, quickly perceiving the rising pressure of the mass popular movement, began making increasingly radical decisions in the interests of Estonians. Valjas defended his changes in the Moscow corridors of power, with support from Gorbachov.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein first visited Estonia, he was billeted at the\\xc2\\xa0ex-First Secretary of the Communist Party of Estonia, Karl Vaino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residence, in Nomme, by order of the premier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Rein slept in Vaino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bed, and had his meals prepared by the long time Vaino housekeeper, who was now apparently unemployed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRestarting in 1987, a cycle of mass\\xc2\\xa0demonstrations\\xc2\\xa0featuring spontaneous singing  and music by Estonian rock musicians, collected 100,000\\xc2\\xa0Estonians\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0Tallinn\\xc2\\xa0to sing national songs and\\xc2\\xa0hymns\\xc2\\xa0that were strictly forbidden during the years of the\\xc2\\xa0Soviet\\xc2\\xa0occupation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 May 1988, the first emotive expression of national feeling occurred during the\\xc2\\xa0Tartu\\xc2\\xa0Pop Music Festival. Five new patriotic songs were first performed during this festival. Alo Mattiisen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive Patriotic Songs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were performed at the Tartu Pop Music Days. In June the Old Town Festival followed in Tallinn. After the official part of the Festival, the participants moved to\\xc2\\xa0the Song Festival Grounds\\xc2\\xa0and started to sing patriotic songs together spontaneously with a lot of emotional verve. 300,000 people flocked to the spontaneous singing gatherings night after night. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26\\xe2\\x80\\x9328 August 1988, a Rock Summer Festival was held, and new patriotic songs, were composed and sung by the powerful voice of Alo Mattiisen, that proved to be mesmeraizing. Following that on 11 September 1988 (Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birthday), a massive song festival, called \"Song of Estonia\", was held at the Tallinn Song Festival grounds. This time nearly 300,000 people came together, more than a quarter of all Estonians alive. On that day citizens and political leaders expressed, through the voice of\\xc2\\xa0Trivimi Velliste\\xc2\\xa0(Chairman of the Estonian Heritage Society), their ambition to regain independence. \\r\\nOn 16 November 1988, the legislative body of Estonia did issue the\\xc2\\xa0Estonian Sovereignty Declaration. In 1990 Estonia was the first Soviet republic to defy the Soviet army by offering alternative service to Estonian residents scheduled to be drafted. Most Estonians simply began avoiding the draft.\\r\\nThe Singing Revolution lasted over four years, with various protests and acts of defiance. In 1991, Soviet tanks attempted to stop the progress towards independence. But in defiance the Estonian Supreme Soviet\\xc2\\xa0together with the\\xc2\\xa0Congress of Estonia\\xc2\\xa0proclaimed the restoration of the independent\\xc2\\xa0state\\xc2\\xa0of Estonia and repudiated Soviet legislation. People acted as human shields to protect radio and TV stations from the Soviet tanks. \\r\\nRumour had it that the Chief of Police and the Mayor (Hardo Aasmae) of Tallinn stopped the Russian tanks from entering the City of Tallinn. They demanded to see the authorization papers for allowing the tanks to enter Tallinn. At the time there was a putsch going on in Moscow (a violent attempt to overthrow the Gorbachov government). The tank commander had no such documents and could not get them easily.The junior tank force commander allowed the Chief of Police to direct his tanks to a field and accepted food and Vodka in return. \\r\\nThrough these actions Estonia eventually regained its independence without any bloodshed,\\r\\nSometime in the spring the Rahvarinne (The Estonian Popular Front) became more active. The Popular Front of Estonia been founded in 1988 by\\xc2\\xa0Marju Lauristin\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Edgar Savisaar (both previously Estonian Communists).\\r\\nThe Popular Front was a supporter of\\xc2\\xa0Perestroika. As time went by, an ever greater chasm developed between the initial thrust of the Popular Front, as leading members advocated mere autonomy within a Soviet system that Gorbachev was trying to reform in a cautious way. The eventual context of the Estonian Popular Front came to stand for true, complete independence. Consequently, the Estonian Popular Front changed a great deal over time, until political parties came to replace such movements in Estonia during the early nineties. This rendered the Popular Front of Estonia an anachronism, and the Popular Front was dissolved in 1993.\\r\\nIME (Ise Majandav Eesti \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Independently Managed Estonia) was a complex socio-economic programme printed and published on 26 September, 1987, in the Tartu newspaper\\xc2\\xa0Edasi. The signatories included Siim Kallas, deputy editor of the leading Soviet Estonian Daily\\xc2\\xa0Rahva H\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4l; Tiit Made, economist and radio and television commentator on international affairs; Edgar Savisaar, Head Estonian Soviet Government and Soviet Estonian state planning committee and Mikk Titma, social scientist. According to the programme, the Estonian economy was proposed to rely only on the (Capitalist) laws of value and commercial-monetary relations. The economy on the territory of Soviet Estonia was to be subjected only to the economic policy of a Soviet Estonian government.\\r\\nThe Self-Managing Economic Programme, as such, was never realised; although some of its elements appeared in the eventual economic programme of the Popular Front. But the programme instilled a general hope in the possibility of economic independence. The political independence movement had started on 23 August 1987 with the meeting on Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in Hirvepark in Tallinn and now was spreading. Many people hoped that Estonia would gradually manage to separate itself from the Soviet Union, or at least achieve greater autonomy.  \\r\\nA new MBA course was designed by Rein at Schulich in 1988 called \\r\\nManaging the Growing Enterprise. It became a very popular course with small business owners and family business persons. Eventually a Family Business special programme was spun off the popular course and went on to Rein founding CAF\\xc3\\x89, the Canadian Federation of Fmily Enterprise, with branches in 20 cities of Canada.\\r\\nMIT/Schulich Enterprise Forum was founded by Rein and his friends from the MIT Alumni Association of Toronto. It became a meeting place in Toronto for venture capitalists, angel investors, consultants and entrepreneurs pursuing new ventures in Canada and persons who needed to network with like-minded persons. The original MIT Forum was founded at MIT, Cambridge, Mass. It had become very famous for its very good track record of supporting the start-up of new entrerprises. Rein copied their proven modus operandi.  The Cambridge Club on Bay Street used to be our meeting place. The Toronto chapter has been active since 1988 and has hosted more than 100 events and had some 5000 participants.\\r\\nRein and some friends decided to sail across the Baltic Sea from Nordhamer (just North of Stockholm) to Helsinki. The World Congress of Small Business had scheduled their annual meeting there. Rein was one of the invited speakers. We rented a 40 foot French Beneteau sloop sail boat  (Beam 12.8 Ft., Draft  6.23 Ft.) called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa Moustace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We sailed from Nordhamer across the Gulf of Bothnia to Marieham, Aland (Ahvenanamaa in Finnish). Aland, a part of Finland, had its own flag and considered itself an independent country. From there we sailed East toward Helsinki. We spent a night moored on a very small small island near Helso Kokar Island in Aland. From there we sailed past Hanko, Finland and up the long estuary to Espoo. Next day we sailed to Helsinki, arriving in the dark. Our electrical system had failed and we had no navigation lights, as we limped into the harbor. We had to look for our berth, we had been instructed to tie-up \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the bright Yellow/Red SHELL sign, you cannot miss it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. But, it was Sunday and the lights were turned off. Fortunately our berth was also near the large Icebreakers which were ominously looming in the darkness. Somehow this convinced to look there.\\r\\nNext day Rein delivered his lecture to a large audience. The podium was located on an especially built high stage and Rein had to walk down a set of wooden stairs to reach the main floor. At the bottom of the stairs there were 11 persons waiting for Rein. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you talk to us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was asked by the obvious spokesman, in Estonian. With a name like, Rein, it was hard to hide your nationality.\\r\\nRein was invited to come toTallinn by Hardo Aasmae, Mayor of Tallinn, as one of three commentators on the IME Reform Proposals developed by the Estonian Rahvarinne (Popular Front). The meeting turned out to be at the huge (2,000 seat) Soviet era \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceducational\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (brain-washing, political) meeting hall. Called during Soviet times the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoliitharidusemaja\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Political Education House) and facetiously as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKarla Katedraal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Karl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cathedral). The latter was a mocking reference to Karl Vaino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heavyhanded use of the Center for Political purposes.\\r\\nRein and friends had to immediately sail their boat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoustace\\xe2\\x80\\x9d back to Nordhamar in Sweden.\\r\\n Six months later Rein kept his promise to Aasmae and flew to Helsinki and took the Old Soviet time Ferry to Tallinn. The old ferry Georg Ots was full of very drunk Finns, who were now allowed, because of Gorbachov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perestroka, to travel to Estonia. Estonian vodka was one third the price of vodka in Finland. Rein went to the top deck, the etern of the boat and was shocked. There hung the biggest Soviet Flag Rein ever had seen. Rein wandered whether he had made a mistake in coming to criticize Soviet Estonia economic policy.\\r\\nOn reading the IME document that he had been given to him for comment, Rein decided that it was far too complex to comment on. The only comment that was warranted was to say that Estonia should leave the USSR and become an independent country, if it wanted to implement IME. At the time, of course, this was a clear goal among local Estonians and an impossible dream for those of us who lived outside of Estonia. Rein, who believes in giving lectures only on topics he is familiar with, decided to deliver a stock speech of his, comparing the decision making behaviour of Entrepreneurs and Bureaucrats (i.e. similar to Soviet Apparatchiks in the Soviet Union).\\r\\nThe audience of some 1000 Estonian business leaders, of course, all immediately took it as a comparison of Estonians and Soviets. What a lucky break for Rein. This was the best possible comment on IME that Rein could make. God clearly helps those who cannot help themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein got to the podium, he realized that he suddenly realized that he had never addressed such a large audience ever in Estonian. He stared at the audience for a time (as he had been taught) and then spoke in Estonian. He admitted his situation and said that he only spoke Estonian he had learned pu to the fourth grade, so he needed help from the audience. (It was a very friendly audience who were impressed that an Estonian Professor from Canada took the time and risk to come to speak to them). Rein said that among the 1000 of you there should be enough English comprehension to help Rein, when he got stuck. Please shout out the Estonian phrase that explains what Rein is trying to say in English. The audience turned into a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseminar/workshop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, of speaker and audience trying to make sense of what was being discussed. This was quite a unique experience. Rein was able to communicate the message that entrepreneurs \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpursue good opportunites beyond the resources they currently have in place\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The apparachicks are only willing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto do the minimum they are expected to, without getting into trouble, with the resources at their command\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein described the research on the behavioural actions that entrepreneurs can take to succeed. The message went over very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther speakers followed Rein, and he sat down and fell asleep in a chair. He was still suffering from the jet lag of a long trip. Several reporters/cameramen snuck up and took photos of the sleeping professor. Right behind Rein on the wall was a very large Communist slogan on a plaque, bas\\xe2\\x80\\x93relief, a kind of sculpture in which shapes are carved so that they are only slightly higher than the flat background.  With hammer and cycle displayed, it shouted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorkers of the World,\\xc2\\xa0Unite (You have nothing to lose but your chains!)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning a photopraph appeared on the front page of the local newspaper. It was sub-titled: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother wise man has come to advise us in Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. During Communist times apparently such pictures were in newspapers, of ideoloques coming from Moscow, preaching The Communist Manifesto, to audiences who looked on suspiciously. This was the first time that Amanda, Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother, had seen her son over 30 years. She was not pleased reading the headline in the Tartu newspaper called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdasi\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Fortunately she was glad to see Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein also delivered speeches in Parnu and Kuresaare on the Island of Saaremaa. Rein traveled from place to place in the back of an old black Volga. His visa stated in bold writing that he \\xe2\\x80\\x9chad to sleep every night in Tallinn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Popular Front co-passengers reassured him that the Russian Miilits (policemen/soldiers) were sticklers for precise interpretation of documents, but that they would talk Rein out of any situation. Besides, Estonia was small enough that we could drive back to Tallinn, from any place in the country, to meet the letter of the Law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis became a particular issue in taking the ferry to Saaremaa, which was more closely guarded (Estonian citizens were often not permitted to travel there, Russians were afraid that from the island it was easier to escape to Sweden by boat).We had to pass through a checkpoint. Rein lay on the floor of the back the seat of the large Volga. A young soldier, probably from one of the Southern \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Republics, checked our papers and waved us through. Rein wondered whether the young man could even read.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein delivered two lectures, one at the Kuresaare City Hall to local officials, the other at the Community Hall to a group of local businessmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived in Parnu after midnight for a lecture at the local \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBusinessmen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Club\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Club was located in the basement of a 6 storey apartment house. Entry was from the back yard and we had to knock on a metal door, which had a slit to see who was on the other side. It looked like the speakeasies during the prohibition era in the USA and during the crackdown on liquor serving establishments in Montreal during the fifties. Inside was a pleasure palace, filled with men who were getting progressively drunk. Pornographic videos played on TV consoles and the music was loud. We were ushered to a table laden with all the delicacies that one would want to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpresident\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Club welcomed Rein, saying that those gathered were very glad to welcome someone from far away Canada, who was willing to take the chance to come to Parnu. He then apologized, saying look at the circumstances the Russians are making us work in and what will happen if this generation of (older) experienced senior Estonian managers dies, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few toasts of vodka, Rein rose to reply. After the usual pleasantries, Rein, catching the mood of the meeting and fortified by vodka, replied with some unexpected fervor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, the current generation, have no right to die as yet, until Estonia is set free! Collectively you have the only memory of how things were in a free Estonian capitalist economy. You must pass on this sacred trust to the next generation!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Many more toasts followed and some tears were shed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sauna and sobering up a bit, Rein delivered his canned lecture about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Difference Between Entrepreneurs and Bureaucrats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Once again everyone understood that the Estonians were the Entrepreneurs and the bad Communist apparatchiks were the bureaucrats. At the end of his lecture, full of emotion, Rein invited the managers, his audience, to select a group of young Estonian young potential \\xe2\\x80\\x9centrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and help them to get to Canada. Rein would then provide them with a 3 month training course and introduce them to Canadian entrepreneurs willing to start joint ventures. And so the East-West Enterprise Exchange was born. Tartu College (310 Bloor St. W.)\\xc2\\xa0became ultimately available, as a residence, for 3 months, while the University of Torornto students were on vacation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Volga also traveled to Tartu where Rein met his mother after 30 years and especially his brother, Tonu, for first time ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 26 Estonian \\xe2\\x80\\x9centrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (24 men and 2 women) eventually arrived at York University for a 3 month management course. Rein had no idea how he would raise the money to deliver such a workshop in Canada. Mari was very surprised, but she was willing to put them all up at our house, somehow.  Thr programme was eventually funded in part by the Estonian government, the Toronto Estonian Community and York University. Rein made speeches to many of the Toronto Estonian clubs in Toronto, asking for money. Many of these ex-refugees did not want to do anything to help the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbloody Communists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, Elmar Tamp\\xc3\\xb5ld, an Estonian Architect and fellow member of our Sakala Fraternity, eventually offered to make the student residence of University of Toronto at 310 Bloor St. W., called Tartu College available, free, for 3 months in the summer while the students were on vacation.The money to pay for the Aeroflot flight to Montreal was paid by the Estonian Government, which was still run by the Communists. Rein met with Indrek Toome the Chairman of the Council of People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Commissars of ESSR \\r\\n(1988 - 1990). He was the then the equivalent of a Prime Minister. He was the last Commissar before Reindependence in 1991. Toome told Rein that the Aeroflot tickets depleted his tiny national foreign exchange budget by 60%, but that it was worth it. \\r\\n\\r\\nChechens are sometimes depicted as being \\xe2\\x80\\x9csimilar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Estonians. Parallels are drawn between Estonia and Chechnya in terms of the small size of country (approximately 1million people) that has suffered from repeated aggression from neighbouring huge Russia. \\r\\n\\r\\nA man called Dudayev has become a famous Estonian hero and he was a Chechen. D\\xc5\\xbeohhar Dudajevi was the major-general commanding a wing of Soviet nuclear airforce squadron based in Tartu, Estonia (Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth town). From 1987 through March 1990 he commanded\\xc2\\xa0the nuclear-armed\\xc2\\xa0long-range\\xc2\\xa0strategic bombers.TheTartu base was one of the most important in USSR. He was the only general from Chechnya in the Russian military, and his family had Cossack roots. \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Dudayev learned Estonian and showed remarkable tolerance for Estonian nationalism. One holiday, he invited Tartu Estonians to the air base and allowed a parachutist to unfurl the Estonian nationalist flag, blue-black-white, of an independent Estonia. More vividly, and bravely, he refused to carry out the orders of the Soviet Government in 1991 and did not shut down Estonian television and Parliament. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in touch with the Estonian underground and offered safety to Estonian dissidents, such as the Popular Front. He received a copy of the semi-secret IME (Independently Managed Estonia) documents promoted by the Popular Front in 1989. (Rein also received a copy for his personal feedback.)  He studied all the economic reforms proposed in Estonia, with the intent of bringing some of them as an example, to copy in Chechnya. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1990, Dudayev returned to\\xc2\\xa0Grozny, the Chechen capital, to devote himself to local politics. He was elected head of the Executive Committee of the unofficial opposition, The\\xc2\\xa0All-National Congress of the Chechen People, who advocated\\xc2\\xa0sovereignty\\xc2\\xa0for Chechnya as a separate\\xc2\\xa0republic of the Soviet Union. On September 6, 1991, the militants of the Congress invaded a session of the localSupreme Soviet, effectively dissolving the government of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. Grozny television station and other key government buildings were also taken over. Dudayev was elected the first President of Chechnya.\\r\\n\\r\\nDudayev was killed on 21 April 1996, by two\\xc2\\xa0laser-guided\\xc2\\xa0missiles\\xc2\\xa0while he was using a\\xc2\\xa0satellite cell phone. His location was detected by a Russian\\xc2\\xa0reconnaissance aircraft, which intercepted his phone call signals.\\xc2\\xa0Additional aircraft were dispatched and fired guided missiles. It has been claimed that Dudayev was killed by a combination of a rocket attack and a\\xc2\\xa0booby trap. He died six days after his 52nd birthday. \\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0US\\xc2\\xa0frequently used such intelligence wizardry to help track down enemytargets. His\\xc2\\xa0cell phone\\xc2\\xa0location data was tracked by\\xc2\\xa0U.S., British, and Israeli intelligence agents.\\r\\nThere is a memorial plaque made of granite attached to the house on 8\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x9clikooli Street,\\xc2\\xa0Tartu, Estonia where Dudayev used to work.The house now hosts Hotel Barclay, and the former cabinet of Dudayev has been converted into a special display room honouring Dudayev.\\r\\nAt his death, Estonia was on the verge of recognizing an independent Chechnya and its new flag flew on the Estonian Parliament grounds.\\r\\nFrom 1987 to 1991 Major General Dzohar Dudajev, was the highest ranking officer and only general from Chechnya. He became commandant of the long range strategic bombing command at the very large Russian airport in Tartu. The following information comes from a book written by Alla Dudajeva, wife of Dzohar, in Estonian, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst Among a Million\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Referring to the fact that there were only some one million Chechens in the world and Dudajev, became their first elected President, and tried to liberate his people from Russian domination. Alla was a rising painter and and an acknowledged Russian poet.\\r\\n\\r\\nDzohar was very interested to learn from the stirrings of nationalism in Estonia and followed events closely. He was apparently supportive of all small country stirrings for independence. He often observed that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Russians will not let the Estonians escape easily from the Soviet Union!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show his empathy for Estonians, he organized an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen Door Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at his previously top secret airfield and welcomed Tartu residents to come and visit. Visitors were allowed to sit in the pilot seats of bomber airplanes and in the cafeteria there was a feast prepared for everyone. Overhead Soviet planes conducted fly pasts and other maneuvers. Parachutists landed on the airfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by far the greatest surprise was reserved for the closing ceremonies. A huge Estonian (blue-black-white) flag was unfurled from a helicopter that dramatically descended from on high. Thereby, USSR Major General Dzohar Dudajev was probably the first person to unfurl the Estonian flag at an official event in approximately 50 years.The Estonian people in Tartu were ecstatic!\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 15 was Dzohar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birthday. When the people found that out, they organized a parade that passed Dzohar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apartment house, throwing many, many flowers at the front door of the house. He had chosen to live with his family in a private apartment house where all the other tenants were Estonians.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen subsequently Soviet soldiers attacked and killed demonstrating civilians in Vilnius and Riga, Alla, his wife, noticed that Dzohar had made a personal decision to get involved with liberation movements back in his homeland. On November 27, 1990 the Independent Chechen-Ingush Republic within the laws of the Soviet Union was declared and this protocol was accepted and signed in Moscow. On October 27, 1991 Dzohar was elected President and he resigned from his rank as major general after 29 years of service. He tried to win the support of Germany, England and USA for an Independent Chechen Republic. Soviet armies were sent to attack Chechnya and President Dudajev and his cabinet retreated with their armed forces into the mountains, to fight a guerilla war. He was eventually killed on April 21, 1996 by a Russian missle fired from an airplane that had Dzohar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coordinates that were broadcast by the cell phone that he carried. CIA from USA was implicated by Alla, they had sold Dzohar a U.S.cell phone that was used to determine Dzohar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location. The Chechen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Russia guerilla war was still continuing on, in September 2007, when this book was written.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of Dudajev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stay, as the last soldiers at the USSR Tartu strategic bomber air base were loading transport planes, Rein and Rein Lepik decided to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the airbase in the name of Estonia. Rein Lepik had been a student with the first group of EWEE students at York University. He at that time was a City of Tartu Councillor and had identification papers to prove this. We pulled up to the main gate, where a very young-looking soldier, with a rifle, was on guard. Rein showed him his identification papers and we were allowed in. In an old beat-up Lada, Rein raced up and down the main runway that once served 100 long range strategic nuclear bombers, Tupolev Tu - 16\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Tupolev Tu-22M\\xc2\\xa0aircraft. At the far end of the runway we saw a large transport plane apparently ready to leave, Rein and Rein decided it was time to depart quickly. Boys will be boys!\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 1 Rein was invited to be Senior Research Fellow at the National Centre for Management Research and Development, affiliated with Ivey School of Business. Through research and workshops Rein was asked to encourage the development of an entrepreneurial focus at Ivey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile at NCMRD, Rein organized an International Workshop of researchers, practitioners, and policy advisors, as a follow-up to the Babson Conference on International Entrepreneurship. Debate centered on the definition of the term entrepreneurship and how to teach entrepreneurship. The proceedings were published in a book, Understanding Entrepreneurship, edited and written by Rein. \\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 17 Rudolf  Hess hanged himself in Spandau prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn C\\xc3\\xb3rdoba province of Argentina, Josef Schwammberger was arrested. He was a concentration camp commandant in Poland in 1943 and 1944, and was accused of responsibility for 5000 deaths and ordering deportation of thousands more to the death acmp at Auschwitz.\\r\\n\\r\\n1989\\r\\nBerlin Wall Falls \\r\\nExxon Valdez Spills Millions of Gallons of Oil on Alaska Coastline \\r\\nRomanian Leader Nicolae Ceausescu and His Wife Are Executed \\r\\nStudents Massacred in China\\'s Tiananmen Square \\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 24 (Estonian Liberation Day, 1918) the Estonian tri-colour, blue-black-white, was hoisted symbolically, celebrationally on top of the traditional Pikk Hermann (Tall Hermann) Tower, next to the Estonian parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nHungary was granted independence from the Soviet Union by Gorbachov.\\r\\nPresident Bush, Sr. and Gorbachov met on Malta and declared the end of the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein received frequent phone calls from Habakukk (Tallinn) and Belobaba (Moscow).  Several Estonian visitors came to the Business School to visit \\r\\nRein.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 19 Presentation regarding EWEE to Saarlaste Uhing at Estonian House. Rein also contacted Estonian fraternities Sakala, Vironia and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 8 It was the time to sand the hull of Antares Lennuk for the coming racing season. \\r\\n\\r\\nApril 9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 11 Habakukk was in Toronto for meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 28 Antares Lennuk was launched and Sakala Komerss held by Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fraternity at Tartu College.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 14 Estonian students/potential entrepreneurs arrived from Tallinn (via Aeroflot and Montreal), to stay at Tartu College. Svitlana Nalywayko and Doug Johnstone were hired by Rein to help with the EWEE (East/West Enterprise Exchange Programme). Enterprise York organized for 26 Estonians (officially from the Soviet Union) to study for 3 months at the Faculty of Administrative Studies and to pursue joint ventures with Canadian entrepreneurs. Interestingly every participant had brought with them several loaves of black Estonian bread and a couple of bottles of Vodka. This probably reassured them that they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go hungry or suffer misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 16 EWEE classes began. Rein used visiting professors from Rotman and FAS and from the Toronto community. Rein did most of the lectures himself. \\r\\n\\r\\nMay 17 The Toronto Estonian Fraternities Association sponsorsed and organized a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwelcome beer bash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Estonian House for EWEE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 25 Rein took the EWEE participants to the Toronto Stock Exchange. This was still the manual era when individual agents would shout out price offerings and exchange quotes on paper notes. It used to be quite a show.\\r\\nA CBC crew showed up to TV film the presence of the EWEE participants.\\r\\nRein stood up on a chair and shouted to the participants, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWelcome to the Cathedral of Capitalism!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He then tried to explain with the help of TSE agents what was going on. The 26 Estonians were agast. It must have been quite a shock to their systems that had been conditioned for too many years by Communists. Subsequently the Vice-President of the TSE delivered the standard TSE lecture for visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the headlines on the newspapers shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommunists on the floor of the TSE!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d CBC and other television stations reported the event in their daily news clips. Joe Clark, the prime minister, saw the television news in his home town of High River, Alberta. Next day he called The Canadian International Development Agency CIDA in Ottawa and asked why they had not funded this program; more on this later. Several Toronto Estonians called Rein asking questions and some were impolite, inquiring why Rein had brought so many Communists to Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 1 Rein Kaarepere and several other Estonian government officials visited EWEE.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 8 Rein delivered a public lecture on EWEE at the Estonian House. Some in the audience were hostile.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 15 Rein was interviewed on CHUM Radio. EWEE classes ended and participants started negotiations with Canadian firms regarding possible joint ventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 18 Prof. Elenurm arrived at EWEE. He became a lead professor at EBS.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 20 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 23 Rein was in Quebec City for ICSB Meetings. Rein as a ranking senior professor of entrepreneurship proposed the motion to establish a Canadian Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. The Quebec small business contingent elected a French-Canadian leadership for the Canadian Council. Rein delivered the Inaugural Adress to the first meeting of the Canadian Council. Because of the small business book (in French), Rein was very popular in Quebec.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 25 Estonian Yacht Club Sailpast took place in Toronto Bay (8 boats).\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 1 Michael arrived at Ian Stott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house in Sydney to serve, along with a friend, as cadet/crew for the summer on Stott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boat, Silver Sharon, also called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe barralong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by close friends.

A human chain, holding hands, was formed stretching from Talinn to Vilnius to express the desire of the Baltic peoples to be free of the Soviet Union. Called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Baltic Freedom Chain\\xe2\\x80\\x9dconsisted of two million people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who joined hands in a 595 km. human chain to protest against the Soviet occupation of their countries. They sang patriotic songs and burned candles.  This demonstration received world-wide coverage in all the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 13 Romulus entered hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 3 - 16 Rein was in Estonia via Helsinki and by Georg Ots. He lectured for Madis Habakukk, at the Estonian Business School students several times (at Suurupi). He appeared on Estonian TV, attended theatre, visited his fraternity house in Tartu for a Komerss and visited the most prestigious lecture hall at Tartu University, called\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAula\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He also spent time with his mother, brother and Milvi.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 9 the Berlin War fell when it was breeched by the Germans from both sides by Germans from the East and West. The East German Communist Republic eventually imploded and was disbanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 16 - 26 Rein flew to Leningrad, took train to Moscow, flew to Tallinn  and then flew to Toronto. At Moscow he was invited to meetings between Brian Mulroney and Mikhail Gorbachov. Ryzhkov and Mulroney signed an agreement on cooperation between the two countries. Ceremony was held on the establishment of a Soviet-Canadian Business Council.\\r\\nDec. 6 Rein met with Alan Berg a Canadian businessman about establishing a joint venture in Tallinn to sell Canadian overstock women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clothes. A third partner was to be one of the EWEE participants. Eventually we found a store being built for rent. There was a tremendous shortage of retail space. The Joint Venture was threatened by the Russian Mafia who wanted the space for themselves and we decided to not become involved with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time before the end of the year the East-West Enterprise Exchange was founded (by CIDA and Ontario Government). That is a funding proposal was sent off to CIDA. Eventually, over 8 years, 860 persons came to EWEE from 17 transitioning former Soviet bloc countries between 1990 and 1997. Rein travelled extensively in Central and Eastern Europe interviewing, speaking and recruiting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelegates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the EWEE throughout the early 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\n1988\\r\\n\\r\\nPan Am Flight 103 Is Bombed Over Lockerbie \\r\\nU.S. Shoots Down Iranian Airliner \\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 21 Rein went to Ottawa to meet with the Small Business Office of ITC.\\r\\nJan. 29 Working with Alex Stewart on his PhD dissertation.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was also working at the York Enterprise Development Center Consulting Group with MBA students, as Director.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb.16 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 21 Rein was in California at California Tech University, Pasadena, Symposium.

Rein reduced his weight, and exercised, in honour of his 50-th year birthday. During the coming summer period he sailed as bowman on a shark boat for the season. Most bowmen in the fleet were macho agressive young  boys, Rein was called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrandpa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. But we came in 20-th for the season in a fleet of some 150 racing boats. Our skipper (Millyard) was 77 and his wife with spinopifida was 75. The skipper was very experienced and knew the winds in the Toronto harbor better that any young punk skipper. Rein was the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyoung\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rookie boy on the boat.\\r\\nDuring one leg toward the windward mark we were being unfairly crowded, from the port side, by a young boat and Rein (grandpa), to avoid a collision, sidekicked the challenging macho bowman and he fell off his boat. We were not penalized and at the Club several members bought us beer, in recognition of the deed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWay to go Rein!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nA similar incident occurred a few seasons later. Rein was singlehandling his 30 foot Alberg, Antares Lennuk, in a Toronto Harbour race. He was being crowded once again at the windward mark, this time from the Starboard side. An expensive sail boat skippered by an egotistical, rich man was not yet broadside and crowding me. Rein drifted a little bit downwind wind and the crowding boat hit Antares quite hard. Once again Rein was feted at the Club. It turned out that the offending skipper had a bad habit of doing this often. Apparently some weeks earlier he had lost a race and blamed it on his boat. Then he had stormed and bought a new boat that had struck Antares. These two incidents were probably the most memorable racing incidents in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career as a sailor. Rein had followed the rules, unexpectantly, but correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 7 Rein was at Innovation York Board meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 13, 20, 27 RCYC race days, repeatedly each week.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10 Rein in Calgary at Shell Canada head office doing research on Management Competences. The research had been set up by Bill Menzel, former Executive Vice-President, who now was an Executive-in-Residence at Schulich. The research in general failed to produce results. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut Rein interviewed a very intersting situation. Pat Lee was an explorer looking for new gasoline fields in Alberta. She, of Chinese extraction, had been trained as a geophysicist to do echo-sounding mapping. Most exploration depends on highly sophisticated technology to detect and determine the extent of these deposits using\\xc2\\xa0exploration geophysics. Areas thought to contain hydrocarbons are initially subjected to a\\xc2\\xa0gravity survey,\\xc2\\xa0magnetic survey,\\xc2\\xa0passive seismic\\xc2\\xa0or regional\\xc2\\xa0seismic reflection surveys\\xc2\\xa0to detect large-scale features of the sub-surface geology.\\r\\nHer husband was also an explorer, but he was trained as seismentologist.       Features of interest (known as\\xc2\\xa0leads) are subjected to more detailed seismic surveys which work with reflected sound waves tthat travel through matter (rock) of varying densities and using the process of\\xc2\\xa0depth conversion\\xc2\\xa0to create a profile of the substructure. \\r\\nFinally, when a prospect has been identified and evaluated and passes the oil company\\'s selection criteria an\\xc2\\xa0exploration well\\xc2\\xa0is drilled in an attempt to conclusively determine the presence or absence of oil or gas.\\r\\nPat Lin had been assigned to areas suspected of having gas fields. These were considered of lower priority, because of the existing company reserves. Her husband was instructed to work in areas where oil was thought to reside. One day, out of curiousity Pat superimposed her contour maps on over her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contour maps and thereby discovered the largest gas fields in Shell company history.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein asked Bill Menzel (former Executive Vice President to intervene so that her findings would reach management at the highest levels. She was promoted and became a heroine, despite malconceived non-femenist company policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 22 Rein sailed as navigator on the 36 foot \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPagan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Blake Van Winkle (LORC) race from Toronto to Port Credit and back on Lake Ontario. Rein also sailed later in the summer The QCYC Open Regatta, ABYC Open Regatta, RCYC Open Regatta, Boswell Overnight Offshore, Donald Summervilee Offshore Overnight, Boulevard Open Regatta, PCYC Open Regatta, IYC Open Regatta, etc. This meant that Rein raced every Wednesday afternoon with the Maynards as bowman on the Shark, Casandra and as navigator on the Pagan on the weekends.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 28 Junior Achievement Annual Board Meeting took place at Bata Shoe Corporation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 23 Rein went to Rio de Janiero to meet with partners on IDRC contract. \\r\\n\\r\\nAug.26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Rein went to Montreal and Ottawa to spend time with family.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sept. 1 Rein exchanged cars with Alan Berg and borrowed his Jaguar to celebrate his 25-th wedding anniversary in Stratford. The Jaguar was Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream car from living in UK and we went to Stratford Festival where we spent our honeymoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 11 Rein was on TV Channel 47 and we celebrated Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 14 Rein was invited to Ontario Premier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Council breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 25 Rein and Mari, as part owners of Gemstone Productions, attended the premiere of their film \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlory Enough for All\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Royal Ontario  Museum.

Rein was on Channel 47 again promoting its release.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 9 Antares Lennuk became ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 21 - 22 Rein was in New York City with Martens and Habakukk to sign the agreement on founding of EBS, the Estonian Business School.

The need for the creation of a new business-oriented curriculum was obvious during those times, in the light of\\xc2\\xa0perestroika. Rein became a one-third owner of the Estonian Business School, which was established as one of the first Soviet era not-for-profit capitalist institutions in Estonia. Rein eventually sold his one-third share to Habakukk for 50,000 Rubles and invested it in The Tartu Commerce Bank, which went bank. Rein sold his share because he did not want to be an owner while benefitting from Canadian Government Grants to EWEE. The lawyers made a mistake and Rein still owns 0.15% of EBS shares as a token memory. At the time it was impossible for Rein to bring the money to a bank outside Soviet jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 1,500 students are now studying at EBS, and the school has partnership contracts with over 70 universities in Europe, America, Australia, and Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll EBS Bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Doctoral programmes have now been accredited by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Estonia. EBS is internationally accredited by the Central and East Europe Management Development Association (CEEMAN). Eduniversal University ranking, which provides information on the best Business Schools, has awarded 4 palms to EBS, which places the school among the top 300 business schools in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 27 - Nov. 3 Peder Christiensen from Arhus, Denmark was in town to work on his dissertation.\\r\\nDec. 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 17 Rein was in Estonia for discussions on IME proposals with The Popular Front.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1990 \\r\\n\\r\\nHubble Telescope Launched Into Space \\r\\nLech Walesa Becomes First President of Poland \\r\\nNelson Mandela Freed \\r\\nBoris Jeltsin declared that all Soviet Republics should reform their own relationships with the Soviet Union and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctake for themselves as much sovereignty as they think is needed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\r\\nThe Declaration was adopted by the First\\xc2\\xa0Congress of People\\'s Deputies of the Russian SFSR\\xc2\\xa0on June 12, 1990. It proclaimed the\\xc2\\xa0sovereignty\\xc2\\xa0of the Russian SFSR and the intention to establish:\\r\\nThe principle of\\xc2\\xa0separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers;\\r\\nThe need to significantly expand the rights of the autonomous republics, regions, districts, territories of Russia (federalism).\\r\\nThe declaration was signed by then-Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR,\\xc2\\xa0Boris Yeltsin. Many Soviet Republics decared themselves as independent republics. United Nations, at first, and then NATO played a significant role in the case of some of the countries, the dismantling their dependence on the USSR.\\r\\nEstonia,\\xc2\\xa0Latvia, and\\xc2\\xa0Lithuania\\xc2\\xa0were admitted to the UN on September 17, 1991. Armenia,\\xc2\\xa0Azerbaijan,\\xc2\\xa0Kazakhstan,\\xc2\\xa0Kyrgyzstan,\\xc2\\xa0Moldova,\\xc2\\xa0Tajikistan,\\xc2\\xa0 Turkmenistan, and\\xc2\\xa0Uzbekistan\\xc2\\xa0were admitted to the UN on March 2, 1992.\\r\\nGeorgia\\xc2\\xa0was admitted to the UN on July 31, 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 24, the anniversary of 1918 (first) independence day, an Estonian Congress was elected consisting of former members of the Popular Front many of whom were now anti-Communists. The Congress debated reforms to make Estonia an independent member of the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nMass demonstrations (organized by Communists) took place on Toompea Hill, the location of Estonian parliament. Savisaar as prime minister went on radio and asked the Estonian citizens of Tallinn to come and defend the parliament Building. Huge crowds came and so did large construction trucks that rolled massive rocks onto the only road up the hill, thereby blocking access of tanks and similar military vehicles onto the Parliament grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 11 Lithuanian Parliament declared historical incorporation into the Soviet Union as illegal, and declared their independence.\\r\\nMarch 18 Estonian elections. Rein was very busy teaching this semester. Habakukk,  Aasma , Urmas Kori, Vahi, Sarap and others visited Rein from Estonia at York University. Organization for EWEE continued with Doug Johnstone and Svitlana Nalywayko. Rein was racing sailboats 2 to 3 times per week.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein spent considerable time with various representatives/former refugees from Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Hungary. Everyone was interested in details about EWEE.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 28 -30 Mari and Rein in Montreal for closing the sale of Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house and packing for his move, to come to Toronto to live with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 14 Abel Gyozevich Aganbegyan (arranged by Alina Pekarsky) visited the EWEE programme and delivered a half day seminar. He was a leading Soviet\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Russian\\xc2\\xa0economist\\xc2\\xa0of\\xc2\\xa0Armenian\\xc2\\xa0descent. In the late 1980s he was one of\\xc2\\xa0Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s chief economic advisers and among the first Soviet economists to voice the need for a restructuring of the economic and business infrastructure of the Soviet Union. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to deliver lectures on entrepreneurship and corporate governance to EWEE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 29 EWEE Convocation took place with the York President in attendance.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari had Partridge, a landscape architect, rebuild their garden around 14 Hilldowntree Rd.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 30    Rein travelled to Moscow by airplane \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by train via Minsk to Vilnius by taxi to Riga \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by taxi via Pskov-Caves Monastery to Tartu. Rein was doing recruiting interviews for EWEE 1991. Doug Johnstone joined Rein in Moscow only.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo satisfy his Estonian heritage Rein visited the most historic site in his life. Petseri Caves is a\\xc2\\xa0Russian Orthodox\\xc2\\xa0male\\xc2\\xa0monastery, located in\\xc2\\xa0Pechory,\\xc2\\xa0Pskov Oblast in\\xc2\\xa0Russia, just a few kilometers from the\\xc2\\xa0Estonian\\xc2\\xa0border. Pskov-Caves Monastery is one of the few Russian monasteries that has never been closed at any point in their existence, including during\\xc2\\xa0World War II\\xc2\\xa0and the Soviet regime. The monastery has been an important spiritual centre for the\\xc2\\xa0Russian/Seto/Estonian people.\\r\\nIvan the Terrible asked for repentance there, the father superior let him take the\\xc2\\xa0tonsure\\xc2\\xa0at his monastery. Tonsure\\xc2\\xa0is the practice of cutting or shaving some or all of the hair on the scalp, as a sign of religious devotion or humility.\\r\\nThe monastery was founded in the mid-15th century, when the first\\xc2\\xa0hermits\\xc2\\xa0settled in local caves. The first cave Church of the\\xc2\\xa0Dormition\\xc2\\xa0was built in 1473. The monastery became an important outpost for defending the western border of Russia. From 1920 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1940 The Petseri Monastery belonged to Estonia. Otherwise the monastery was one of the few active male monasteries in the\\xc2\\xa0USSR, \\r\\nSince the\\xc2\\xa0fall of the Soviet Union\\xc2\\xa0the monastery has flourished. Currently the monastic community numbers over 90 who through their pastoral labors live the tradition of asceticism and eldership. In 2013 the monastery marked the 540th anniversary of its existence.\\r\\nNew borders had suddenly arisen between Estonia and Latvia. Young boys with rifles, and confused faces, did not know what to do about a Latvian taxi dropping off \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca Canadian on the Estonian side of the border\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nRein got out of the taxi and started to walk across the border, with Latvian boys threatening him with their rifles. Rein shouted in Estonian for help from the Estonian side of the border and a young officer finally came and got Rein safely across the border. Crossing the Estonian-Russian border was no problem and Rein eventually returned to Toronto.\\r\\nOctober 3 The German Democratic Communist Republic, as an entity, ceased to exist, and its territory was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 6 The process of democratization in Estonia was described to Rein (and is paraphrased here) as follows by Toivo Miljan a political science professor from Laurier University and an Estonian. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe debate was on the fundamental question of the basis on which an (economically) independent Estonia should be constructed \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\xe2\\x80\\x98The first Republic\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of 1918 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1940 ... the second 1940 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1988 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 or the third since 1988/91 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 a question was, who was acting \\xe2\\x80\\x98legitimately\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on behalf of the Estonian people \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 two bodies \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the Estonian Congress (elected by a large number of Estonians in Estonia and abroad) \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 or the Supreme Soviet of Estonia (as the representative of Soviet occupation forces), The Supreme Soviet viewed the Estonian Congress as being toothless and largely ineffective in furthering Estonian independence. The Congress represented the view that the past 50 years should be wiped out completely and replaced by a restructuring plan called IME (Independently Managed Estonia) that had been developed by the Rahvarinne (Popular Front). There was considerable fear that a total revamp of all Soviet political and social structures, at once, would lead to chaos and much suffering by the people. The latter was an example of the bad advice given by American economist Jeffry Sachs in Poland. It was quoted as evidence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince May, 1990, under the leadership of Edgar Savisaar, the Estonian acting as quasi-prime minister, three levels of negotiations had been established:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Intra - Baltic Cooperation by means of the Council of Baltic States.\\r\\nNegotiations between each of the Baltic States (Coordinated by the Council) and various oblasts (state governments in Soviet Union), the 15 Soviet republics and as well with the cities of Moscow and Leningrad.\\r\\nThe so-called vertical negotiations with the Kremlin were becoming less important, because of their loss of central control. This was supported by President Yeltsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to \\xe2\\x80\\x98get Russia moving again\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and incidentally, to undermine Gorbachev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political position.\\r\\nNov. 22 - 25 Aganbegyan in Toronto and Rein acted as his host. Luncheon in President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dining room, address to students, Advisory Committee, CBC/W5 and CTV appearancess, hosting a special dinner for Aganbegyan. Rein asked Agabegyan about the future of the Soviet Union economy (based on his understanding of IME). His reply, very agitated, took 4 hours of  discussion.

Yeltsin lead demonstrations against the Communist putsch which tried to take over the USSR government by force. Yeltsin will always be remembered for delivering a speech, condemning the putsch, by standing on top of a tank in front of the Rusian Duma (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cParliament\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), with his fist held high. Divisions of Russian military supported Yeltsin. Behind the scenes George Soros, Hungarian billionaire from New York City, through his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen Society\\xe2\\x80\\x9d organizations, provided a valuable system of communications that the apparatchiks lacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coup in the Kremlin unravelled as quickly as it began. Two days before, it looked like the absolute worst was about to happen. But suddenly, with Moscow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority having collapsed, the impossible dream of restoring independence became possible literally overnight for many former Soviet Republics. Estonia declared re-independence on August 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an article that Rein and Jaak Leimann, the deputy premier of Estonia at the time, wrote 10 years later, the following quotes capture the tense situation at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaak Leimann recalled that during the summer of 1991, no one was, as yet, predicting the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, in retrospect, it was clear that all the signals were there. The head of the government for the Soviet Union, at the time, V. Pavlov had called a meeting of the representatives from the 15 Soviet Republics and many more members representing the central Soviet government. One of the small ornate halls of the Kremlin was filled to overflowing, with more than 100 persons attending. Leimann represented Estonia. The question under discussion was what to do about the deteriorating economic situation. No one seemed to know what to do. Nor was such a large group conducive to productive policy development. The meeting ended with no decisions taken, confusion prevailed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI (Jaak) returned to Tallinn convinced that the Soviet Union was no longer viable, And that the preparations which we had started to make for independence and for transition to a market economy, were on the right track. We were clearly way ahead of the other jurisdictions in the Soviet Union\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nFollowing the restoration of independence from the Soviet Union,\\xc2\\xa0Russia\\xc2\\xa0was one of the first nations to re-recognize\\xc2\\xa0Estonia\\'s independence. Iceland was the first Western free nation to formally recognize Estonian Reindependence, on August 22, and established diplomatic relations on August\\xc2\\xa026, 1991. Representatives of the Estonian government promised to support Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s membership in the European Union and did so. Estonia\\'s immediate priority after regaining its independence was the withdrawal of\\xc2\\xa0Russian\\xc2\\xa0(formerly Soviet) forces from Estonian territory. \\r\\n\\rSovereignty Declaration from the USSR \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Deklaratsioon Eesti NSV Suver\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4nsusest had been declared on November 16, 1988 during the\\xc2\\xa0Singing Revolution\\xc2\\xa0held at the Song Festival in\\xc2\\xa0Estonia. On Aug. 23, 1989, two million people formed a massive Baltic Chain that passed through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and spanned all 3 capital cities via a 430 mile joining of hands on the Vilnius-Tallinn road in protest against illegal Soviet occupation.  Songs were sung, that demonstrated that here were 3 independent cultures, demanding that the world and USSR recognize them and that they were not Soviet peoples.\\r\\nThis earlier declaration also asserted the supremacy of the Estonian laws over the laws of the\\xc2\\xa0Soviet Union.\\xc2\\xa0Estonia\\'s parliament also laid claim to the republic\\'s natural resources: land, inland waters, forests, mineral deposits and to the means of industrial production, agriculture, construction, state banks, transportation, municipal services, etc. in the territory within Estonia\\'s borders.\\xc2\\xa0November 16 is now celebrated annually as the \"Day of Declaration of Sovereignty\".\\r\\nEstonia had gained its first independence as an\\xc2\\xa0aftermath of World War I\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0the Estonian War of Independence\\xc2\\xa0(1918\\xe2\\x80\\x931920). In 1940 as a consequence of The Molotov \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Rippendorf Treaty, Estonia was\\xc2\\xa0occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union, with no interference by Nazi Germany.\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0majority of Western nations refused to recognize\\xc2\\xa0the incorporation of the Estonia\\xc2\\xa0de jure\\xc2\\xa0by the Soviet Union and only recognized the government of\\xc2\\xa0Estonian SSR\\xc2\\xa0as de facto\\xc2\\xa0or not at all.\\xc2\\xa0Most Western countries recognized Estonian/Latvian/Lithuanian diplomats and consuls who continued to function in the name of their former governments. Some of these aging diplomats (appointed by an independent Estonia) persisted in this anomalous situation for some 47 years. The former housekeeper, of the London Estonian embassy, was the last one still alive, from those who had been appointed by a Free Estonia. She attained diplomatic status, for Estonia, in the diplomatic core of world ambassadors in UK.  Mari, when she was in her pre-teens was looked after by this lady, when her mother, Marfa, and Mari, lived at the embassy after escaping from World War II.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0On September 6, 1991, when the USSR recognized the independence of Estonia , and it was readmitted to the\\xc2\\xa0UN\\xc2\\xa0on September 17. \\r\\nAfter more than 3 years of negotiations, on August 31, 1994, the armed forces of\\xc2\\xa0Russia\\xc2\\xa0withdrew from Estonia. The Russian Federation officially ended complete military presence in Estonia, after it relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in\\xc2\\xa0Paldiski\\xc2\\xa0(for submarines in the Baltic Sea) on September 1995. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia was unusual among the three Baltic countries, both in a leading role it took in negotiating its independence, and in the bloodlessness by which it happened in Estonia. Estonia joined\\xc2\\xa0European Union\\xc2\\xa0in 2004, shortly after it became a member of\\xc2\\xa0NATO.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn academic colleague of Rein, Jaak Leimann, who became Minister of Economics and Deputy Premier, recalled that, by 1989 the political spectrum had widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily in Estonia. The republic\\'s\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupreme Soviet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been\\xc2\\xa0transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (November 16, 1988); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the\\xc2\\xa0Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union\\xc2\\xa0that November; a language law making Estonian the\\xc2\\xa0official language\\xc2\\xa0(January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).\\r\\nDespite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking bodies, since 1989 different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front had a proposal to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called \"third republic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Citizens would be all those living there at the moment, but it found less and less support over time.\\r\\nDespite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as new lawmaking bodies, the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front\\'s proposal, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIse Majandav Eesti\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (IME), which Rein had been invited to Estonia to comment on in late 1989, had become obsolete, in the fast moving political turmoil.\\r\\nJaak Leimann recalled that the many consultations with Western, Estonian and other expatriates proved to be of little help.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThrough these consultations, we in the government lost any misconceptions that we might have had about what a market economy entailed. But more importantly, we were shocked to learn that no one had any experience or understanding of how to move from a deteriorating planned economy to a competitive market economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn August 1991, during the Communist coup in Moscow, the Premier of Estonia was abroad and Jaak Leimann served as acting Prime Minister during the first day of the 3-day coup. These were times of danger and crisis. The cabinet met several times a day. What to do about the Russian tanks that were reportedly approaching the Estonian border? It was decided that resistance was out of the question since Estonian border guards (really customs officers) were only armed with small side arms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuring the first day of the coup, there was a total lack of reliable information. I remember that we all gathered around the television to watch CNN. We devised several possible scenarios, from the very black to the more hopeful. Fortunately, we were eventually able to declare re-independence from the Soviet Union, and our momentum to carry out reforms was only temporarily interrupted for perhaps 3 days.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJaak Leimann recalls that one of the most agonizing decisions made involved the liberalization of the price of bread. This may seem unreasonable to the Western mind. But, at the time, and in the Soviet context, this was a major issue and departure from previous dogma. The central authorities in Moscow had set the price of bread and vodka at ridiculously low prices to appease the masses. Bread, in particular, had attained a great symbolic significance to the general populace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Gorbachov government in Moscow was afraid to take any such a measure, unilaterally, and encouraged the smaller Estonian jurisdiction to experiment with policies that lead to the changing of the price of bread. The Estonian public were scandalised by the change, but eventually accepted it as a part of a larger package of economic and political reforms that promised other benefits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJaak Leimann was often asked to reflect on what Estonian government might have done differently, given the perspective of the 10 years that had passed (by 2002). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe underestimated the need for a well-trained quality labour force and should have invested more in vocational training programmes.  We also should have put more emphasis on the implementation of all the laws we passed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more inspection and enforcement officers should have been hired and trained. Our court processes were too slow, we needed more experienced lawyers and judges who could deal with the new rules in the land \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 But I was by 2002, more concerned about our future. How fast can the Estonian economy grow and will it be ready to compete as a full member of the European Union? Demographically, our population of 1.4 million was aging \\xe2\\x80\\x93 made up of 400,000 pensioners, 600,000 workers and 100,000 unemployed and 300,000 students and the young. Political power, through the ballot box, was in the hands of the aging. How much more change will they be willing to endure and support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the next10 years were not easy for them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe night before on August 19, Russian tanks had cruised the streets of Tallinn and Tartu as the attempted coup d\\xe2\\x80\\x99etat in Moscow played itself out. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconquering\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Russian soldiers were confused because no orders were coming from Moscow.  Estonian government ordered the tanks to withdraw to their Estonian bases and lacking orders from Moscow (which was in absolute chaos) the Russian officers obeyed and thus avoided a possible catastrophie. They were also treated to a sumptuous dinner and vodka.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Rein and Romulus visited Amanda in Estonia for the first time after 46 years. They traveled from Tallinn to Tartu to Valga in a chauffer driven Volga car supplied by the Estonian Prime Minister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offfice. Rein was officially the Prime Minister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guest. The driver announced upon arriving in Valga that he was very low on gasoline and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to get some more. (To this day, Rein wonders what his real motives where). To get gasoline in those days you had to have connections, you could not just drive to a (non-existing) gasoline station. Rein asked the driver to drive to the taxi stand in the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main square. There he approached the only driver waiting for a fare. After some introductory comments, the driver identified himself as being a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMulk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Viljandimaa (Sakala), a very entrepreneurial group of individuals, much like the Quebecois in Beauce, Canada. (Rein had learned this during his academic research activities). After some repartee exchanges with the taxi driver, Rein started to demean the Russian occupation, which was still in force, locally. \\r\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMulk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreed and responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are in a sorry mess and I am embarrassed by what you Rein (from Canada) have to see that is going on in Estonia, etc. etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Being desperate for gasoline, Rein replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I agree with you. What a country, where you cannot even get gasoline even for a 20 US dollar bill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein removed a US$ 20 (a lot of money at that time) from his wallet and waived it about. In 1990, such money probably represented about one month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pay for the taxi driver. He took the bait and announced that he would help. First, he offered a can of gasoline he had as a reserve from his trunk (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBagaasznik\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), to top up our tank. Then he suggested that we follow him to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctaxi park\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where there was gasoline. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeave it up to me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, he reassured Rein.\\r\\nAs fate would have it, at that very moment, a big fat Russian \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbabushka\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sat into the backseat of his taxi and demanded immediate service. Panic crossed the taxi driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStay here, I will get rid of this woman quickly!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Off he went and returned in no time, looking much relieved that we were still there. At the taxi park he took my US$ 20 and disappeared into the building that controlled the pumps and we received our gasoline. Later on we discovered that he had probably used up his weekly ration coupons and paid off whomever needed to be paid off , and we were all thankful.\\r\\nIt was proof that it was good to know the culture of your own country, Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein, Romulus and Amanda, continued their visit to Tallinn, Tartu, Valga and to the Markhanse Farm in Puka. It was from this farm that Romulus, Rein and grandparents Daniel and Amalie had escaped by horse and carriage to Parnu and thence to Germany in 1944.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 20-27 Peder Christiansen stayed with us at 14 Hilldowntree Rd.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec.1 Michael graduated from Etobicoke Collegiate Institute. The Principal commended Michael for leading school programs for avoiding drugs and similar undesirable losing recreations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 16 Rein Flew to Helsinki - Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tartu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Helsinki \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Toronto \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Vancouver \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Victoria - Toronto. He came to Tallinn to meet with Tiit and Marika from People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Front. Rein was pursuing the establishment of a Baltic Management Centre, in particular he was trying to convince the Economics Department at University of Tartu to join with University of Latvia and University of Lithuania to put together a joint venture that would teach Western management methods in a separate venture. It became clear that they were too comfortable in their government jobs to take the entrepreneurial venture Rein proposed seriously. Rein eventually abandoned the project. \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterward another business school, the EuroFaculty, was established in Riga. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first director, the Estonian-Canadian Professor Toivo Miljan had to build up the EuroFaculty from the very bottom up. The EuroFaculty suffered from a lack of legality, funds, conflict which could only be ignored during the pioneering period. He ended up being forced away by the European Commission because of his anti-bureaucratic mannerisms. New waves had changed the rules, and the idea that the EU would support the EuroFaculty in line with the Baltic Sea donor countries was subsequently derailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 15 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Toronto \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Paris \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Geneva \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Paris \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Toronto Rein working with friends at the International Labour Organization on entrepreneurship curriculum used by ILO.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 25 Gorbachev resigned and Yeltsin became President and declared the end of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union effective January 1, 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\n1992\\r\\nOfficial End of the Cold War \\r\\nRiots in Los Angeles After the Rodney King Verdict \\r\\nMany high ranking Soviet officers knew how their bread would be best buttered. Estonian governments, after peacefully negotiating for the return of the conscripted troops from their country were stuck with the problem of what to do with the former Soviet officers who did not want to return to Russia. Many of them were long retired; well-established with property, unlikely to go back to what few confusing roots they may have had in Russia. And then there were the middle-aged recently retired, still capable soldiers, whose presence in Estonia was seen then as a security threat. That threat had lessened, after Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NATO membership, but it had not gone completely away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe numbers were considerable. According to the Interior Ministry almost 30,000 such officers and their family members lived in North Eastern Estonia, near Narva and the Russian border. They were not granted resident status. Their temporary resident papers needed to be renewed every two to three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 3 Dezso Horvath and Rein travelled to New York City to see George Soros, whose Open Society Foundation Communication system was the only news system operating at the time of the Communist coup in Moscow and helped bring down the Putsch takeover of the USSR government. Soros had helped to finance a network of internet centers in 33 universities around the country.  George Soros was a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist of Jewish-Hungarian ancestry and held dual citizenship. He apparently was affiliated with the CIA. He is still known as \"The Man Who Broke the\\xc2\\xa0Bank of England\" because of his\\xc2\\xa0short sale\\xc2\\xa0of\\xc2\\xa0US$10 billion\\xc2\\xa0worth of\\xc2\\xa0pounds, making him a profit of $1\\xc2\\xa0billion. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe played a significant role in the peaceful transition from communism to capitalism in several Eastern Europe (1984\\xe2\\x80\\x9389). It is sometimes said that Soros was the visible face of a vast nasty network of private financial interests and global politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoros was friendly with fellow Hungarian Dezso Horvath. We approached him for a financial contribution for running the EWEE programme, which he granted for 3 years. It was a successful trip and we celebrated by going to hear the Opera, Fidelio, at the Metropolitan Opera House.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 18 Rein Loik, former EWEE graduate and now President of Estonian Air and the Tallinn Airport, came to York.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb. 29 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30 Rein Flew to Dallas to meet with the International ACE student Consulting organization and thence to Winnipeg.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 10 Rein appeared on CKFM.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 13 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 April 15 Rein and Svitlana flew to Moscow \\xe2\\x80\\x93Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tartu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Riga \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Vilnius \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Prague \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Budapest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Toronto. Recruiting for 1992 EWEE Delegates.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 8 EWEE 1992 started.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 7 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 11 Rein in Moncton for National Conference on Entrepreneurship Education and AABS (American Association for Baltic Studies).\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 16 City of Toronto Reception for EWEE participants.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 July 12 Rein and Mari went to Paris for Babson Entrepreneurship Research Conference and to visit Peder Christiensen in Brussels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sept. 1 Antares Lennuk Cruise took place on Lake Ontario with Mari, Jenny and Scruffy from Toronto \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Frenchman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bay \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Coburg - Port Hope \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Picton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Kingston -  Cananoque in the Thousand Islands and back. This was a distance of 286.5 road km., or a 4 hour drive by car. At one point we became grounded in a gravel bar, going down the wrong side of an island passage way and were rescued by a fisherman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boat. At a marina we were told that there was no damage to the hull. Then our propeller got tangled in weeds as we docked in downtown Kingston. A young nan/diver cleared our propeller. We arrived in Gananoque in time for the evening\\xe2\\x80\\x99s show at the Playhouse. We docked right in front of the dock at the Playhouse and slept the night in comfort and convenience. This was the best way, ever, to go to theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the return home to Toronto we ran into the back end of the hurricane, Andrew, and raced for security at Coburg and spent the evening with Eric Winter and wife. Eric, retired, had been the Master of Calumet College. We waited two days for the storm to calm down, when we noticed that the former owner of Antares departed through the gap into the lake. We decided to follow (if he can do it, so can we). \\r\\n\\r\\nWe discovered that the previous owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boat was now 40 feet long and could ride the disturbed waves, but our 30 foot boat was being bounced around dangerously. Rein checked the chart and headed for Port Hope and found the range poles for the harbour entrance on shore. The chart did say that sailboats should beware. We followed the range poles dutifully and struck the bar in front of the entrance way and were swamped by a huge wave astern. Eventually the agitated water brought the boat to a passage way past the bar and we entered a small square ancient asylum harbour where square rigged Brigatines had been turned around 180 degrees in the past. To us it looked like a pot of boiling agitated water. The Warfinger was yelling at us that we were too big to come and tie up at a buoy. Rein replied saying that he was not going back into the storm and the warfinger eventually relented. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter successfully tying up on a buoy Rein rowed ashore and we spent the night at a room and board house. Next day was totally calm and we limped home to Toronto on our iron jib, the Ford Atomic-6 inboard motor. Antares Lennuk looked after us better than we looked after her, she had been a very fine and patient lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 9 -10 Rein flew to Ottawa (CIDA) and then Montreal (father).\\r\\nSept. 20 Estonia voted for the first Riigikogu (Parliament) and the first President since the Soviet occupation of 1944. Lennart Meri, a poet, historian and writer, became a worthy President and role model. Sept. 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Oct. 3 Rein flew to Boston for Family Firm Institute meetings.\\r\\n1993\\r\\n\\r\\nCult Compound in Waco, Texas Raided and Killed All in Fire \\r\\nLorena Bobbitt Takes Brutal Revenge  \\r\\nUse of the Internet Grows Exponentially \\r\\nWorld Trade Center Bombed \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 3 In Dresden, Germany, reconstruction of the famous Frauenkirche church began. The church had collapsed because of Allied bombing in 1945, when Romulus and Rein had been escaping through Dresden. The old bricks from the bombed out church were saved and arranged to commemorate the damage done by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bombers at the behest of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bomber Harris. The rebuilt cathedral became an example of cultural class and religious victory over one-man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal brutish hangups.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 22 - 31 Rein flew to Frankfurt \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Prague \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tartu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 London. In Prague he was to meet with Vladimir Dloughy, Minister of Industry and Trade, Czech Republic and Otto Jelinek, a Canadian Cabinet Minister and world champion figure skator. We met at the Check Management Centre located at \\xc4\\x8cel\\xc3\\xa1kovice, some 40 minutes by train from downtown Prague.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CMC was located in he main square. The large Communist-built building (you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recognize it instantly -- only Communists could create such eyesores). People visited from all around the world and lived in \\xc4\\x8cel\\xc3\\xa1kovice attending classes and living at the CMC. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prague riot police had brutally broken up student demonstrations on November 17th 1989.  Day after day, and in ever-increasing number of the demonstrators, filled Prague\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wenceslas main city Square, chanting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTruth will triumph\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\'ve had enough\\xe2\\x80\\x9d! This came to be called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Velvet Revolution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia by the end of December, 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe years immediately after the Velvet Revolution, when the CMC MBA program started in \\xc4\\x8cel\\xc3\\xa1kovice, were great. There were lots of changes, positive expectations. This was a tremendously optimistic period. Rein served on the Board of Directors, representing Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Poland, the anti-communist movements originated from the working classs and the shipyard workers in Gdansk. Among the Czechs, it came from the intelligentsia\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the writers, the poets, from the songwriters. That is it came from the top rather than from the bottom of the society.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrague was a mecca for classical music. There were concerts galore. Nightly concerts featured the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Antonio Vivaldi, not to mention such Czech composers as Antonin Dvorak, Leos Janacek, and Bedrich Smetana. We tried to attend concerts by all of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc4\\x8cel\\xc3\\xa1kovice since the 11th century had been a religious and superstitious place. The church at the center of town attested to that, and more evidence was found in the way 11 skeletons were placed in a grave. Their hands and legs had been tied, their heads were cut off, and rocks were placed on their bodies. Apparently, he superstitious people who had buried them were worried that the 11 skeletons would return from the dead and attack them.This humble church reminds one of how different an experience some people have had compared with ours. This was also true about the recently departing Communists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Czech Republic coined the word (lustrace) in 1990 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually adapting it from previous usage by the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secret service. Lustration (literarily: clarification through light and fire) implied that individuals were screened for the so called responsibility of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d violations, on basis of documentation from the former Communist secret services. In practice, the term lustration was used for the disclosure of personal files both for vetting initiatives and for inspection of victims and others involved.The law on lustration banned people from office for 10 years. The law required officials to provide sworn affadavits concerning their possible cooperation with the secret police. The public interest spokesman (lustration prosecutor) then verified the affidavits and brought suspected cases of misrepresentation before the lustration court, a special three-judge panel whose decisions could be appealed. Several high-profile cases had not yet come before the court.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nBy comparison, in Estonia almost no such KGB files were left, so the process was purely voluntary. In 1995 a law was adopted according to which all the Communist ex-functionaries and secret services employees were obliged to report (membership in Nazi Germany intelligence agencies was also listed as a targeted activity). Only 1,153 of persons did it, and from 1997 till 2004 only 250 names of those who tried to hide their connection to oppressive regimes were ever published. No other options had been tried besides this voluntary confession based system.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein slept in the big Chelacoviche Communist Montrosity and it turned out that his room was still bugged. Le plus cela change, le plus il reste le meme chose?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Prague as a member of Czech Management Centre (CMC) Advisory Board, Rein attended meetings at the Centre and delivered a Workshop on Entrepreneurship at a Forum underway at the Centre. The topics discussed dealt with the economic, political and social environment for entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic. Conclusions reached:\\r\\n\\r\\nEntrepreneurship was important to economic development.\\r\\nWho should speak for the entrepreneurial sector?\\r\\nThere is a need for supportive legislation.\\r\\nA moral code needs to be implemented that emphasizes ethical and societally desirable behaviour.\\r\\nPoor attitude in country: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would rather be poor than help my neighbour get rich.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAttendees called for over 80 changes that the government needed to undertake \\xe2\\x80\\x93 basically a total revamp of all the economic policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was agreed that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrategic Business Club\\xe2\\x80\\x9d be formed, associated with CMC, for CEOs only who had received pre-screening . They agreed to work with EWEE and send candidates for the next session. At a meeting with Irwin Schwartz in Prague (a Canadian lawyer), EWEE was promised links with Canadian companies that had gone to a recent trade mission to the Czech Republic. Rein also met with the Dean of the Faculty of Economics, downtown, who agreed to work jointly with the CMC. Finally, Rein met a Mr. Somol at the Ministry of Finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a representative of CIDA who had allocated funding for CMC, Rein agreed to the following projects:\\r\\nRenovation of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCanada Room\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at CMC with simultaneous translating equipment.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCanada Scholarships\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for deserving Czech academics to travel to Canada.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCanadian books\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in library with ex-libris stickers giving credit to Canada.\\r\\nAnnual \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEntrepreneurship Excellence Award\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, with winner allowed to travel to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Dean of CMC took Rein for dinner at a swanky restaurant downtown Prague he parked his Skoda car right in front of the restaurant. We could see it through a window. After dinner we discovered that the car had been put on cement blocks and the 4 wheels/tires had been stolen. Things were clearly not yet totally normal in Prague.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 30 Rein arrived in Tallinn. Rein had an appointment with the head of the Estonian Privatization Agency, a Herr Schmidt. He had been recruited from (West) Germany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s privatization agency,Treuhand, that had helped supervise the mass privatization of East Germany after the fall of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBerlin Wall\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He brought his first hand experience and methods to the privatization that was about to start in Estonia. Rein was tempted to take some leave from York University and come to Estonia to work at the Agency being formed. Schmidt was interested, because several consultants were being recruited through CESO, a Canadian government agency. But Rein eventually declined. The Estonian Agency carried out the best privatization process of all the former Soviet Union Republics. Nine years later in 2002, Rein co-authored an article that documented the results achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Tartu Rein met with his mother, Amanda, and the President of Tartu University, Aaviksoo and his deputy Kallikorm, and a senior academic Villems. Under discussion was the reform of the Department of Economics that tried to also present itself as a Business School. Other professors, from Laurier, Toivo Miljan a political scientist and Toomas Palm and economist from Oregan state University were also involved. Miljan eventually became (the frustrated) head of the Euro-Faculty Programme of the University of Riga.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein attended a faculty meeting at the Department and found the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofessors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d very defensive and unwilling to change. Many of them had graduated from Soviet academic programmes, such as Scientific Communism, Retail Food Quality Management, and Socialist Economics. What they knew about capitalistic economies tended to be limited to books which they had read and parroted in class (without letting the students to read such books, so as to give themselves the implied authority). Rein, on interviewing several students, who complained that most of the lectures were too abstract and not useful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are reading the Western books to us, although the younger professors are better than the old.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBentley College from Massachusetts was concurrently running courses for the faculty members, mostly in accounting and economics. Rein, while at Babson College (next door to Bentley) had spent some time advising them and discussing the situation in Estonia. The Estonians found the Americans too opinionated and aggressive, but they had a lot of money from USAID which included laptop computers and study trips to USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with Andres Arrak and Rein Lepik, two former graduates of EWEE, Rein invited candidates to apply to the next EWEE programme in 1993. A special teleconferencing seminar was being organized for transmission via a declining Canadian satellite, Olympus, to classrooms in Tartu and Moscow. Candidates from Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Estonia were invited to attend.\\r\\nFebruary 9 In London, UK, Rein visited the European bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) where he knew a former EWEE Board member Lou Naumovsky and also a graduate of the IMBA programme from Schulich (an Estonian, and Rein prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9e), Urmas Paavel. The goal was to raise additional funds for EWEE and perhaps funding for business school reform in Estonia. Rein also met with Prof. Saul Estrin at the London School of Economics who was active in educational reform in Central Europe and he promised to send some names of potential EWEE candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 12 - 13 Rein had a meeting with Dean Search Committee at Odette School of Business. A large committee of some 12 persons fired challenging questions at Rein, which Rein tried to answer for 3.5 hours. He also met with President Ron Ianni and Vice-President Academic Bill Jones. They will decide whether to offer the Deanship of the Faculty of Business Administration to Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 18 Brrrr cold! Rein took a one day trip to Winnipeg. Meetings with people who claimed they could help EWEE find Canadian companies interested in doing joint ventures with EWEE participants/entrepreneurs. The Manitoba Grain Trust wished to do business with someone in Budapest and wanted an introduction to the wealthy stock advisor, and Hungarian, Andrew Sarlos on the EWEE Board. Western Diversification wanted to do a deal in Kazakstan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can we help find a partner? Peter Washeyshyn was interested in former Soviet airport in Tartu, and seeking funding from EBRD. A Les Johnson wanted a contract of C$5,000 plus expenses to find Canadian companies in Calgary and B.C. who would be interested in doing business through EWEE delegates.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 21. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPat your Boat Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the beginning of the 1993 boating season at RCYC. Rein went to see how Antares Lennuk had survived the winter. Boat needed waxing and the keel needed a new coat of paint against mussels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 23 Rein was invited back to meetings in Windsor, apparently they were interested in Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s candidacy for Dean.  Meetings with Paul Cassano, VP Development, Julian Cattaneo, Academic Planning Committee, Jim Thacker \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaster negotiator\\xe2\\x80\\x9dof the Faculty and the resident union man, All Academic Areas, Guy Allen, Assistant to the Dean (administration), Andy Andiapan, Associate Dean. Everybody was checking out the possibly of a new boss. Rein was careful to not make any commitments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 24 Meeting with Bill Jones, VP Academic, our negotiations had begun. He talked of the level of other salaries at Windsor, Rein talked about his current salary plus extra stipends (for EWEE and as Director of Entrepreneurial Studies). There was a large gap. Final decision on the appointment would be made at next Faculty Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negotiation goals and results were:\\r\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost important was to negotiate an up front discretionary Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fund to be used at Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discretion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Possibly from President or\\r\\nMinister of Education Cooke, a Windsor graduate and known to Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter much negotiation Rein received only C$ 50,000 from \\tBill Jones, no commitments were  made from the President for anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClarify financial projections and cash flow for Faculty of Business for 5 years\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nIt turned out there were no plans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill Bill Jones, VP Academic may be a part of my problems?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nNo commitment to work with Faculty on AACSB Accreditation, because it would lead to a demand for more faculty resources.\\r\\nThe negative signals were all there and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perceptions were close. Although the real problem was the President who delegated very little power to Jones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsked for one additional hire and a replacement for senior Prof. Mike Zin in Accounting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\ti.\\tBegrudging agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNegotiate a revenue sharing agreement with the Administration on any new projects that the faculty initiates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nExecutive Development programme.\\r\\nFamily business seminars for family-owned\\tautomotive parts manufacturers.\\r\\nNo commitment. To be negotiated later on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEric West, former dean, to stay on until September, 1993 while Rein prepared financial and other plans for the Faculty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\ti. \\tNo agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccess to Windsor Alumni Club of Toronto to support Faculty initiatives\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\tBegrudging agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at this list 14 years later, it all seemed too na\\xc3\\xafve. The enthusiastic support of all the Faculty of Business Administration was not there. Rein had made up his mind several years ago that he too wanted to be a Dean. Most of his closest friends had become deans and kidded Rein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein was too willing to become Dean at a University that needed his entrepreneurial skills to become linked to the auto industry and Michigan, USA. No appreciation of the blocks that the union would throw into his way for any new teaching programmes involving unionized professors. Lessons: don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be too optimistically over-willing to try and turn around a grounded ship. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to become a hero. But things progressed, too far, quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 25 Back at York Rein needed to complete teaching the 6 MGMT 6100 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmasters theses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d groups. He had to disengage from his responsibilities with EWEE and pass them on to a new Executive Director. Complete work with 3 PhD students: Ron Mulholland, Owen Pegg and Neil Wolfe. Complete the Intermediate level sailing course at RCYC called North U.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 19 Jones made an offer. His offer, effective July 1, was better than the standard Windsor offer for deans, as a matter of fact the salary turned out to be larger than his own. All other expenses related to the move would be covered by the University and a discretionary fund of C$ 30,000 was agreed for the move. All past debts of the Faculty were erased, and the faculty hiring budget was also agreed to. It seemed that Jones really wanted to have Rein join the Faculty as dean (after the fact it seems that he actually went beyond the limits set by the President.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 19 Deszo Horvath, as Dean, agreed to give Rein a two year unpaid leave of absence (because he was convinced that Rein would soon come back to York). Termination date for York salary purposes was to be January 1, 1994. Rein was to continue serving on EWEE Advisory Board and be available on telephone for advice. Research projects with York faculty and PhD students were to continue. Dr. Eric Cousineau would become interim Executive Director of EWEE. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 April 6 Rein flew to Vilnius \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Prague \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tartu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Stockholm \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Toronto. EWEE prospects and CMC Board Meeting,  He visited Mother and Tonu.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 26 Rein and Mari began house hunting in Windsor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 31 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 June 1 Rein at CFDMAS Meetings with all the other Canadian Deans in Calgary. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is about time Rein, finally, welcome!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 27 Governor General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Competition for Jenny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skating programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective July 1 Rein was elected Dean, Odette Faculty of Business Administration, University of Windsor and was appointed to the City of Windsor Economic Development Commission. The letter of appointment arrived in March. Immediately the telephone started to ring, as Windsor faculty members were jockeying for political advantage, so much for confidentiality. Rein moved into a huge well appointed Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office by the end of March and commuted to Windsor. Many of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends had become deans across Canada and had always kidded Rein as to when was he going to join the club. Undoubtably they were the ones who nominated his name for consideration by executive search companies. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein actually had a choice of being considered for Dean at Windsor or at St. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s University in Halifax. His good friend, fellow entrepreneurship researcher, and Vice-President Academic at St. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flew to Toronto to have lunch with Rein \\xe2\\x80\\x93 trying to convince him to come to St. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. After some consideration, Rein decided to stand for election at Windsor because it was closer to Toronto where all his experience and contacts were. Also in case he did not like the job he could return to York University which was closer by. He was also aware of the politicized environment in Nova Scotia after being recruited previously by Dalhousie.\\r\\nThis was the fifth time that Rein had let his name stand for a Deanship, first at York University (he came in third), then at University of Waterloo (he was offered job as Director/Dean, but declined), at Dalhousie in Halifax (he came in second) and fourth at University of Victoria (he came in second). At Dalhousie a former Nova Scotia deputy minister of finance was clearly the better choice in a very politicized province. At Victoria the cards were stacked against Rein, because a friend of the Selection Committee received the offer. This was a brand new business school that tried to find a unique segment to compete in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 entrepreneurship, tourism in Asia and international business. The first dean ran into many difficulties and eventually resigned, Rein felt lucky that it hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been him.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhat Rein hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realized was that Windsor was also a very politicized place. About 40% of the faculty supported Rein, another 40% were against him (mostly people from the labour union), and 20% were people who had for many years been outcasts in the Faculty and supported Rein hoping that they would once again be appreciated. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment was announced in the Globe and Mail Report on Business:\\r\\n\\t\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Ron W. Ianni, President, University of Windsor is pleased to \\tannounce that Dr. Rein Peterson has been appointed Dean of the \\tFaculty of Business Administration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Peterson previously held appointments at York, Western Ontario, \\tand Columbia University. He has served as Vice-President, Cape \\tBreton Development Corporation, as Consultant with the World Bank, \\tas Director of the trade development program \\xe2\\x80\\x93 East/West Enterprise \\tExchange and as founder of the Canadian Association of family \\tEnterprise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWindsor Business School, in the new state-of-the-art Odette \\tBuilding, consists of 50 full-time faculty members. Located in the \\tindustrial/automotive heartland on the US/Canada border, WBS is \\tcommitted to working closely with its alumni, business and \\tprofessional communities. The WBS Co-op MBA program is unique \\tin Canada. Dr. Peterson invites alumni and friends of WBS to contact \\thim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEileen Fischer was appointed Director of Entrepreneurial Studies. Rein was granted a two year leave of absence to be Dean of the Faculty of Business Administration, University of Windsor. Dezso Horvath, as Dean at Schulich and as a personal friend, was less than pleased with Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. When the two year leave of absence was up and Rein informed him that he was staying at Windsor, Dezso extended Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leave of absence by one more year without consulting him \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when later that year Rein had his heart attack, Dezso called and offered him his job at York again. This time Rein accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time Odette Business School was ranked number 7 in Canada by the Canadian Business Magazine. In the past, Windsor had ranked as the best accounting school in Canada and many of the senior people in Canada in the Chartered Accounting profession, including those running the C.A. Professional designation, were Windsor graduates. The Private Investors Society in Canada that advised and trained persons managing their own investment portfolios was based at Odette. It was agreed by the President and the Vice-President Academic that Business Administration would be considered one of the elite programmes at Windsor that would be promoted heavily to the public (and presumably would receive the necessary funds to grow). Located in Windsor where Chrysler, Ford and General Motors had major automotive plants in Windsor and across the one mile wide Detroit River, right next to the Ambassador Bridge. The direction and opportunity for growth was obvious. It also fit well with Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in engineering, and Windsor had a very good engineering faculty specializing in automotive industry skills and research. Sounded like an excellent opportunity to build a Faculty specialized in the of automobile industry and US-Canada business relations. These markets had not been pursued in previous years by other business schools in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Rein became dean, he was struck by a reality shock. He discovered that no faculty member considered the automotive industry as a specialty that they were interested or qualified in. Nor were any of them interested in the industry. There were no students at the Faculty from nearby Michigan/USA. Faculty members thought of themselves as being at a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clast chance university for business students in Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, located at the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cend of a cul-de-sac\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Southwest end of Ontario. Sort of out of the mainstream, they preferred to have comfortable jobs, that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require them to produce research publications or offer exciting newly designed courses or programmes. They wished to continue teaching in their narrow specialities, some of which (e.g. finance) were badly out of date with the latest developments. They were teaching the same materials that they had learned themselves at PhD courses many years ago. They relied heavily on the University Labour Contract which protected them from doing too much work.  There were only 11 MBA students left in the programme and most facultypreferred to teach just Bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level courses, which apparently required less work. According to the Union contract, in the first year, Rein was forced to pay for a one full credit course in which there was only one student \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this was considered by the faculty member assigned to the course as the major coup of his career as a union member.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an Executive Development Centre at the top of the business building, but there were no regular courses offered there to the public. At an early Faculty Meeting in the Executive Centre, Rein pointed to the Ambassador Bridge, which was visible from the window, and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not accept your position that we are at \\xe2\\x80\\x98last chance U\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and in a cul-de-sac hinterland. Forty percent and sometimes more of Canadian GDP crosses over that bridge over there. We are at the front door of the largest economy in the world and I, as dean, intend to pursue policy decisions accordingly!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was not well received by the 40% of dissidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was only the beginning of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reality shock. The Faculty was soon asked to make severe budget cuts of around 40%.  University of Windsor was in serious financial trouble and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to know what to do about it. The President was a demagogue lawyer who had no idea how to deal with such a financial crisis except by ordering across the board cuts to everyone, with no view to consequences. The obvious thing to do was to increase revenue. \\r\\n\\r\\nRein helped organize a deans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 action committee to help deal with the crisis. The Deans published, with Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership, a plan to reorganize the finances of the University, emphasizing the increase of revenue.\\r\\n  \\r\\nRein started a co-op B.Commmerce programme, an aggressive student recruitment programme (\\xe2\\x80\\x9call top local top high school students must be personall y approached to come to the Odette Business School\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  Rein started rebuilding the MBA programme (which had deteriorated to a total of only 11 students). He invested $30,000 from his discretionary fund. He initiated discussions with the local Ontario business community. Most worthy local firms had given up on the Faculty as an entity and only used faculty members as less expensive personal consultants. The President of Chrysler Canada wanted a custom-made degree for his senior managers, but the Faculty voted it down.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 9 Rein was in Windsor working with faculty members, learning procedures and policies and meetings with Area Heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 10 Rein participated in the Island Yacht Club Open Regatta. Located on Algonquin Island in the\\xc2\\xa0Toronto Islands,\\xc2\\xa0Queen City Yacht Club\\xc2\\xa0(QCYC) has been a part of\\xc2\\xa0Toronto,\\xc2\\xa0Canada\\'s sailing community since it was founded in 1889. Toronto at the time was known as the \"Queen City of the Lake\". \\r\\n\\r\\nRein had Antares Lennuk trailered to Westport Marina on Lake St.Clair.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 4 Budget Meetings at Odette, Rein consulted with previous Dean Eric West. He said Rein had to tell Allen how much sessional budget he has to schedule and he then works out preliminary schedule which goes to Area Heads. There was danger of losing our graduate assistants budget. Faculty wanted smaller classes (25 maximum instead of 40). Eric also pointed out that socializing with the faculty as a whole had not worked out for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 13 Rein appeared on local CBC.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 28 Nanny and Romulus moved to Windsor. We all stayed at an university\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old rented house on the campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug 30 -31 Mari and Rein packing furniture with moving company. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood- bye good first home where both of our children were born!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 1 Rein wrote letter to Faculty promising positive leadership.

Hurst.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 7 Closing date for renting 14 Hilldowntree Rd.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 24 Faculty Meeting at Odette, Rein steps down as Chair and a new chair is elected. Rein wanted to participate in debate as a faculty member.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 16 Fall Convocation at University of Windsor and the installation of new Deans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 18 Rein joined the Windsor Rotary Club. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt a meeting with Deans President Ianni expresses the following Opinion:\\r\\nUniversities are not accepting of planning.\\r\\nBecause of our union history this university belongs only to the people.\\r\\nI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recall the Senate being anything but a paper tiger.\\r\\nIf it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen at the Faculty level it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen.\\r\\nIt cannot be planned from top down.\\r\\n\\r\\n*** WHAT A HORRIBLE MESSAGE \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 NO LEADERSHIP GIVEN !? \\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 26 Alumni Day, a confidential report  given to Rein as Dean by 5 alumni:\\r\\nOdette courses were short-term and historically oriented.\\r\\nFaculty members were down on themselves and Windsor.\\r\\nMost students did respect their professors.\\r\\nNew Dean was seen as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutsider\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nDid not give the new Dean a chance to finish his presentation.\\r\\nEric West, the previous Dean, was not regarded well by alumni.\\r\\nOdette needs a VISION!\\r\\nWhat is the market for a Windsor degree?\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 27 Students reported that an accounting professor gave the same examination each year and it was possible to buy a copy from previous students. Some students took an old examination and wanted to show it, in protest, to the professor. He was not in his office and they went in without permission and the students left the old examination on his coffee table (with a note). Police were called and they did not take any action. The accounting professor refused to say anything to anybody. It was important that some students cared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result Rein put together a new student course overview brochure that proudly shouted in its headline \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMANAGEMENT IS AN ART!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The many sculptures and paintings donated by the Odette brothers were photographed, featured and integrated into the message about the B.Sc. and MBA programmes available at the Odette Business School. No comments reached the Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office about this very different brochure from the past years. But, Rein thought that was a response in itself \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the message was heard by many \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 we are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca last chance university in a cul-de-sac of Southwestern Ontario\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.We as a Faculty need to travel back to where we started.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 28 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 31 CFDMAS Meeting of Deans in Ottawa.\\r\\n\\r\\nSigns that MBA Marketing is entering mature stage.\\r\\nDownsizing Western  (1 MBA section) York (Part time -20%).\\r\\nBachelor demand appears to be holding.\\r\\nCustomized in-company programmes.\\r\\nMiddle management in demise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov.10 Meeting with Louis Odette. Primarily interested in his art work, especially sculptures being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstored\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the Odette Building. Wants one statue moved to the sidewalk, this will reguire a crane. As Dean, he wants Rein to serve on Art Committee and have a say as to art chosen for the building. It seemed possible that there were tax schemes involved in the donation Odette gave the University, using the Odette Building as an art gallery. No opening to bring up the Business School\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general need for funding. He jumped at my idea of a special brochure featuring \\xe2\\x80\\x9chis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sculptures and art. He said he would give us $5,000 for the Brochure and instructed Ianni to match it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 16 CAF\\xc3\\x89 Founders Board Meeting at Granite Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 19 Accounting Area Lunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value-added of our accounting programme is misperceived.

The AACSB Accreditation Process includes rigorous self-evaluation and peer-review elements. The process begins with the submission and approval of an Eligibility Application.

Accreditation is expected to attract more and better students.\\r\\nJuly 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHead Start Programme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for students started at Windsor.\\r\\nJuly 20 The Federal Republic of Germany issued a postage stamp marking the 50th anniversary of the attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. \\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 25 Reinwas asked to attend at a complaint meeting with union.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 6 Jenny continued her volunteer commitment to the Windsor Association  For Riding ForThe Handicapped.

I was hired to come here and build a world class business school. I cannot do this without financial and other support from central administration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Business school is expected to reduce budget by at least 10% over 1995 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1996. Where will this money come from? Ninety percent of current budget is made up of salaries of unionized faculty \\xe2\\x80\\x93 only way to reduce would be to not replace any retirements and thereby increase size of classes. Central administration was seeking to make artificial cuts that were impossible to implement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 dreaming in technicolour.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan 5, 6 Academic Deans met over budget cuts.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 11 Rein met with his Executive Committee and informed them of the budget crisis and that Business Faculty would probably lose one secretary. Budget for sessional instructors would be reduced.  Rein had informed Jones that the Business Faculty was alarmed. Jones replied that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are in very difficult times. Business school enrolment was down and that Science, Education and Social Science have made cuts. With the Business School enrolment being surpringly down, we had lost our negotiating position.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 12 Louis Odette called (worried about his name being on the building and Faculty). Rein informed him of the budget cuts and financial crises at the University, hoping that he might somehow intervene on our part with Ianni. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 13 Rein started to organize a Business Advisory Council (of external business leaders) with the hope that they would help counter balance the budget cut attempts. Membership would come from Windsor business community and elsewhere. Union members insisted that the union be represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 14 President Ron Ianni made a speech, a supposed overview of the financial situation at the university.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will not allow a cumulative deficit, like the rest of Ontario universities, where they range was from $5 to $ 25 million.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have to realize that the hole is not at the other end of the boat.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will have no layoffs, loss of wages --- this has been our social contract historically (like a good union town should).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAcrimonious debates broke out in University Senate as Dennis Tuck, on behalf of a Task Force (Strategic Renewal Committee), presented his report on strategic planning for the university. Major disagreement was expressed on the proposed new Mission statement for the University. The new Dean of Engineering said that she was mislead about the financial situation of the university and was not going to be held to by central office budget cuts.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 23 Rein agreed to have the Bachelor of Commerce programme become, Co-op, whereupon students could spend some time during their studies working at local businesses. The Business faculty had always resisted such change because of a fear of having to do more administrative work. As Dean Rein never asked the Facuclty, whether he could proceed.The programme became very successful and attracted better and more students to the Windsor Business School.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 23 Louis Odette surprisingly agreed to fund part of the cost of a Professorship (executive development) at C$ 25,000 per year. The objective was to start earning some money for the faculty from courses taught to executives from the business sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a Windsor Chamber of Commerce meeting, Rein made an unacceptable suggestion that Windsor had always had a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparasitic relationship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the much larger City of Detroit, whether running illegal liquor across the Detroit River during the Prohibition or being a safe-haven for Bingo players or now being a safe-haven for gamblers at the Casino. We need to undertake initiatives that defend these relationships and explicitly try to develop some more. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a basic economic reality for all \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecond cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the world. This was considered to be too blatant and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould only occur naturally\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Nevertheless, some change in their mindsets became apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein proposed that the Business School run a duty free store at the Ambassador Bridge to earn money for the faculty. Coop students could do their experience terms there and students could work part time. The profits from this operation would go to our faculty budgets.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein explained at Faculty Meetings about the university\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial crisis and how this would affect the Business School negatively. Faculty members were not used to hearing such bad news. The intention was to make the financial problem one that was faced by all faculty not just the dean (which they preferred). The faculty wanted to be left alone, to teach their courses and not be burdened by such administrative issues. Everyone assumed that the Union contract protected all of them and that they themselves had nothing to worry about their life-time jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 31 Telephone call from United Nations Secretariat asked Rein to prepare an update on his research paper \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWomen Entrepreneurs in Developing Countries\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be presented at UN meetings in New York in May 1995 and to be published in the UN Journal of Economic Planning. Rein agreed to write an updated paper. He had written such a research paper some 5 years earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 3 Rein proposed that the President make available funds or facilities for 2 classrooms so that the Business school could start teaching students via teleconferencing in Wallaceburg, Chatam and perhaps in Sarnia. This would increase faculty revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 20 All the Academic Deans continued to meet weekly to discuss a common front against the administration that did not know what they were doing, when it came down to details. The enrolment projections for University of Windsor were down 38% and with only 45 students coming from outside of Ontario. Perhaps the optimal minimum size of Windsor should be 8,000 students, down from the current 10,700. Students had been allowed into the university some years ago without receiving increased support from the Ontario government. A very weak situation for the university that the students abhored.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 21 CISC (Community Investment Corporation) initial meeting was held in Windsor sponsored by the Chamber and the Business School. The CISC was an Ontario government programme to make funding available to entrepreneurial businesses. To create jobs the province would provide some seed capital and the rest would have to be raised locally. This would involve the Faculty with the local business community and gain some reputation. Such initiatives had not happened often in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 23 Rein involved in several conflicts as mediator between faculty members who were not doing their jobs properly and had not been  challenged in the past. Some faculty also filed grievances against the Dean under the union agreement. Apparently the previous deans always paid such people off rather than deal with the issues. Rein started right from the first saying that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo ahead and grieve, I am not afraid of the grievance procedure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Not too many grieved after that during the 3 year period of the deanship. At first, Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand their culture and game. The faculty would come into the dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office and say that they had a problem. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reaction would naturally be to listen and try to talk about the options, etc. What was expected of the dean was for him to reach into the left hand drawer of his desk, where he kept the union agreement, and jointly we were to figure out how to beat one of the clauses so as to benefit the faculty member. Rein refused to play that game.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 28 Flew to Tallinn University in Estonia, Rein, Tony Faria and John Dickinson (two Windsor faculty) and delivered an executive development programme on using a computer-based management simulation game called MARKETRAIN. The goal was to train Estonian faculty members and executives on how to use this training tool in training programmes. The programme was very successful and we were invited to come back the next year. It was hoped that the Windsor business school could establish some exchange programmes in Estonia. We also met with Alexela the largest chain of gas stations in Estonia that had been established by a former EWEE participant. Discussions were also held with Lembit Soots the most successful Estonian entrepreneur, who had previously lived in Toronto. He was not very encouraging of Windsor being able to earn income from such educational programmes in Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 7 Academic Deans met with Eric Harbottle, the new VP Finance who reported that the 1994/95 deficit had been C$ 1.8 million and the projection for 1995/96 was C$ 700,000. This was not received as a very useful message from the supposed person who was going to bring about new constructive changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 16 - 20 Rein flew to Ljubljana, Slovenia to participate in an executive development programe for managers from former Soviet countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 21 Rein helped to redesign (with the Public Relations Department) the Faculty brochure to display the beautiful art in the Odette building and to challenge the implication that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe were a last chance U\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Brochure was met with quite a bit of resistance from faculty who found the new image of an exciting place to study hard to swallow. As dean Rein started to attend Area/departmental meetings to see what was discussed and to try and change negative culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 24 Faculty Council Meeting to discuss cuts to University and Faculty budgets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 28 Rein taught his usual Entrepreneurship course to the undergraduates, using his favourite case about corporate entrepreneurship at Technotronics, Inc. Rein had decided right from the start of his tenure, as dean, to teach one course a year to stay in touch with the students and what was happening in the classrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein gave $30,000 to agroup that wanted to expand the MBA programme. This amount was the total sum of discretionary funds that Rein had saved up in the Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 5 Rein flew to Toronto for day to attend the EWEE Advisory Board. Rein was keeping his options open in case he would have to return to York University.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had helped to negotiate a publicity deal with Harvey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hamburger restaurant next door to the Odette Buliding. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelp Upgrade the Faculty of Business Computer Lab! We will donate 50 cents from each coupon to YOUR Computer Lab. You will save 66 cents on a Great Meal Deal!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 6 Rein met with former dean Eric West to discuss the possibility of launching a special EMBA programme for Chrysler Canada senior managent that would be taught at their premises. Many in the Faculty were unwilling.\\r\\nApril 11 Rein attended the AACSB Meetings at Ann Arbor, Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 21 Rein served on Iona (United Church) College Board of Directors.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 27 Meeting held with Andy Andiapan (Associate Dean) to see if he could help launch application for AACSB Accreditation. He was less than enthusiastic. His contribution to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Deanship was nil. \\r\\n\\r\\nApril 28 Jenny attended the Centre for Creative Arts at Walkerville Collegiate Institute, a secondary school located in the olde Walkerville area of Windsor. We lived nearby at 1144 Devonshire Street in a house that had been built by a rich whisky smuggler during the US Prohibition. Jenny could run to the School in less than 5 minutes through the backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former town of\\xc2\\xa0Walkerville\\xc2\\xa0Ontario is a heritage precinct of Windsor incorporated in 1890. The town was founded by\\xc2\\xa0Hiram Walker, owner and producer of\\xc2\\xa0Canadian Club\\xc2\\xa0Whisky. He established a\\xc2\\xa0distillery\\xc2\\xa0on the\\xc2\\xa0Detroit River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood is characterized by large houses, wide streets and abundant greenery. Willistead Manor, a 36-room mansion that sits within a 15-acre park was built in 1906, the Manor was briefly the home of Edward Chandler Walker of Hiram Walker, Inc. Other structures included former\\xc2\\xa0Prime Minister\\xc2\\xa0Paul Martin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home, Kahn-designed houses, the distillery (now belonging to\\xc2\\xa0Wiser\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) and the\\xc2\\xa0Via Rail\\xc2\\xa0station.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period of\\xc2\\xa0Prohibition in the United States, Walkerville became a principal source of cross-border\\xc2\\xa0alcohol\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cexportation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The bulk of alcohol consumed in USA during prohibition was manufactured smuggled covertly in Walkerville.\\r\\n\\r\\nHiram Walker favoured diversification and Walkerville originally welcomed many industries including the automotive industry. The\\xc2\\xa0Ford Motor Company of Canada opened its factory there in 1904, followed by the\\xc2\\xa0E-M-F Company\\xc2\\xa0whose plant was acquired by\\xc2\\xa0Studebaker\\xc2\\xa0in 1910.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 3 - 7 Rein flew to Guadalajara , Mexico and attended the Colloqium on Academic Linkages between Canadian and Mexican Schools on the ITESM campus. Exchanges of students between universities and shorter visits to foreign universities could be funded by government. Rein explored the feasibility of 3 exchanges with UNAM, ITESM and PUEBLO and the Windsor Business School. This would be a possibility in the longer run.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 8 Rein agreed to the organization of Bingo evenings with volunteers from Faculty serving on the Bingo house floor. This was the time honoured way of raising money in Windsor. So why not! Potential revenue would be \\r\\nC$ 2,000 x 12 = C$ 24,000 per year. This venture was organized by one of the secretaries and Rein and Mari served also as volunteers. This secretary was very concerned about the financial situation at the Faculty and took it upon herself to help. This was very encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 19 Rein discussed establishment of a joint B. Commerce/ B. Engineering degree with the Engineering Faculty. Students were very interested, but resisted by the Dean of Engineering. But the Dean of Science was interested. The programme would be called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement of  Automotive Technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommercialization of technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rein decided to not accept the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Engineering dean and agreed to proceed with The Faculty of Science. A similar proposition was examined with the Faculty of Fine Arts. Business students would learn about presentation skills and negotiation skills. Already there were some students who had managed to slip into related Faculty courses, including Engieering. Integration would take some time and resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein met with Tony Faria and Peter Mateja, whom he had appointed co-directors of Automotive and Vehicle Research. Peter\\'s interests lay in research in the transportation field, assisting businesses in the Windsor - Essex County area. He was also interested and involved in helping start-ups/entrepreneurs commercialize new products/services. He was a part time instructor with a lot of business experience and supervised a number of students who took an Independent Studies\\' course. When Rein had discovered that no one of the full time faculty was interested in Automotive Studies, he took 2 rooms in the building and put up a sign saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutomotive and Vehicle Research\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It might have been possible to have business students audit courses in other faculties alongside course work on an Independent Study with Mateja, that Rein could give credit for.\\r\\nSome faculty became involved (i.e. John Dickenson and Tony Faria). After resigning from the deanship, eventually, a group of researcher/consultants in the Faculty became involved with the Automobile Industry. Someone had to point out to them that there was an obvious opportunity to work with APMA, possibly Chrysler and the Faculty of Engineering at Windsor that was setting up an engineering research centre at the industrial park. President of Chrysler Canada, Landry (a jovial Quebecer) was interested in closer ties with Odette Business School. In particular, a number of senior executives (e.g. VP Renaud) lacked a university degree and were thereby excluded from any promotions within the Chrysler US organization. Rein tried to organize a special programme for Chrysler executives, granting them advanced standing based on their extensive managerial experience. The Administration and Faculty Council blocked this.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently President Ianni and his favourite Dean of Engineering excluded the Odette Business School from any involvement with Chrysler Canada. Rein today wishes that he had told Landry that he was willing to go ahead with his EMBA proposal if he made this a pre-requisite for any funding given to Engineering through Ianni.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 3 The Odette Business School was the host for the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada (ASAC) Meetings at the University of Windsor. Rein had invited them to come to Windsor and it was considered an honour for the Faculty. Rein, as Dean, delivered several speeches welcoming everyone and had provided some funding from his Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget. Concurrently the Canadian Consortium for Management Studies met and discussed future co-operative research projects. Also concurrently, all the Canadian Deans of Business met as the Canadian Federation of Deans of Management and Administrative Studies (CFDMAS).\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 18 Antares Lennuk was launched for the summer. During the upcoming summer, Rein travelled several times to Toronto to race on the Pagan.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 24 Because of the workload and pressure, Rein decided to start running between meetings (for the exercise). He cracked his cartilage (Meniscus) in his left knee while jogging. From a visit to a specialist in London and an MRI it was concluded that the cartlige had worn so thin that it was liable to crack. Presumably this was a result of the time that Rein had run track back in the 1950/60s. There was no easy way to repair a worn/cracked cartlige and if it becomes a major problem, the old knee would have to be replaced by an artificial one. It was decided that let us wait and see how the knee reacts. The cracked Meiscus was still unrepaired in 2016. Eventually other more serious ailments gained priority like the coming heart attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 26 Rein approved the preparation of a feasibility study by Walter Manney (Faculty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computer technician) for exploring the purchase of new equipment for the computer lab.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJune 27 We met again with the next door franchisor, Harvey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, who were willing to give WBS and other Windsor students special deals (and a royalty to WBS, for buying equipment in the computer lab.) if we promoted their business: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSAVE AT HARVEY\\xe2\\x80\\x99S, SUPPORT THE FACULTY OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Similar arrangements could be investigated with others, if this arrangement worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 3 Emergency Meeting on the budget was held by the University Administration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow will you (the Deans) cut 9% from the faculty budget?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The administration was still dreaming in technicolour. B.Commerce enrolment for Odette was apparently down by 28%. If we at Odette School of Business were able to raise extra funds from outside ventures, would this mean that we would lose any earned money through larger budget cuts? Rein saw this as a very likely scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 6 Rein appeared on CBC TV show (Susan Little) discussed the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpositive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d things that were happening at Odette Business School ---  negotiations for joint programme opportunities in Jamaica, Estonia/Baltics, Mexico, APMA, and CISC. Apparently the Windsor audience was not used to hear positive messages according to the interviewer. Some of the faculty members informed Rein that the rules of the Windsor Faculty Association (Union) will \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you if you bring such new ventures within the university. This is why most of the faculty had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexternalized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d all their consulting activities and conducted these as individual contractors. Rein also contacted Ramona, Dean of Continuing Education to see how her Faculty could help us --- not at all promising.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 15 Telephone call from Agafon (University of Houston) interested in doing executive education with Odette. Rein agreed to one trial seminar, possibly in October.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 16 New PhD graduate, Feng Liu, turned up at the Dean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office and asked for a job. Well trained and desperate with a family to support and in difficult financial situation. Rein had discovered, previously, that the Finance Department at Odette was at least 10 years out of date, therefore this serentipidy was of great interest. Scraping together all the funds possible from the Faculty budget and getting permission from the Administration and the Finance Area, Rein was able to hire Feng Liu on a one year contract at a very, very low salary. Liu was very thankful because he was desperate. Feng Liu was quite a shock to the others in the Finance Area, who soon realized that they were out of date and needed to upgrade their own skills and the courses they taught. Rein subsequently helped Feng Liu to get a job at McGill University, where his friend and Dean was Wallace Crowston. Rein had hired Wallace from M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass, when he was Area Coordinator \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Management Science at Schulich school of Business. Feng Liu became a very successful member of the Faculty at McGill and organized the involvement of the Faculty in China, which was just starting to boom. Feng Liu remained a friend and Rein eventually participated in a workshop in X\\xe2\\x80\\x99ian, China.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 9 Rein attended Automotive Conference in Traverse City, Michigan, called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlobalization, Innovation and Speed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Current automobile industry drivers were apparently affordability, globalization, customer individualization, and IT information systems, and the industry was not keeping up, especially with the Japanese competitors. All of these topics could be introduced into the Odette curriculum and the General Motors Institute in the US might be willing to provide advice to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 25 Rein delivered lecture to EWEE using one of his favourite cases, Belkin. Which in Russian means \\xe2\\x80\\x9csquirrel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and in some student minds described the entrepreneur in the case called Belkin, a lot of jokes resulted always.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust/September. Rein was getting ready for the new academic year with many bureaucratic details and meetings. Executive Committee agenda listed the following initiatives: Office of Automotive Research and Training, Business Resource Centre, CISC, Jamaican EMBA, two potential exchange programmes in Mexico, Bingo fund raising, AACSB Accreditation, Agafon Strategios Executive Development proposal, Joint degrees with Faculty of Engimeering and New faculty member Feng Liu.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 11 On Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birthday, Rein travelled by early VIA train to Toronto to lecture to executive program organized by Alina Pekarsky for managers from the Russian metallurgical industry. Rein arrived home in time to take Mari out to a celebratory dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 15 Special Faculty Council Meeting had Vice-President addressing the faculty, discussed budgets and proposed reorganization, with Faculty of Business Administration being combined with Education or Science, First year entering class down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10.8%, Faculty of Business down in enrollment -137 students from 1988/89 peak year, Jones was pleased that undergraduate Coop programme was launched --- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe cannot continue just doing what we have done in the past \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 22 Rein met with the representatives of the local community college, St. Clair College. Transfer agreement for their 2 year business programme was arranged. Tony Faria spoke to St. Clair who ran an excellent automotive technicians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 programme which could be tied in with the Faculty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office of Automotive Research and Training.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 8 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 12 Rein flew to Kingston, Jamaica to meet with President Winston Adams of the College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST). The proposal was for WBS to offer a block of business courses on alternative weekends, to supplement CAST courses, and to offer a CAST EMBA degree and Certificates of Completion from The Odette School of Business. Windsor faculty would fly down to teach, earn extra income, and have an opportunity to enjoy the beaches. CAST and WBS would share the student fees and the Odette Faculty would receive the surplus for its budget. The Bank of Nova Scotia, one of the largest banks in the Carribean and had a big office building in (rather run down Kingston city centre). Rein met with a Mr. Clarke and he agreed to contribute funding and to facilitate such a joint venture. Rein met with others from UNESCO, Island Victoria Bank, Lilieth Deacon, LLB, Grace, and Kennedy & Co. Ltd. to discuss the proposed joint Venture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Windsor many concerns were expressed by the Administration: What will be the liability of the University of Windsor? Non-accredited partner, who is CAST? No business plan? We may need approval from Faculty of Graduate Studies, etc., etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 20 Faculty Council Meeting, Rein made the following statement: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been asked to comment on some rumours in the halls. I have not resigned as Dean. Because of the severe financial crisis, I and others in this Faculty are looking at our options, should this become necessary. I know that many of you have options and I have some options.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently Dezso Horvath\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer to Rein to return to Schulich School of Business had been leaked to the Faculty. Rein had not accepted and asked Dezso to give him some time. He, of course, as always was sure that Rein would give up my \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfoolish venture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Dean at Windsor. Rein decided to deal with the rumours openly to hopefully gain some leverage with Jones and some faculty members \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who would be more likely to support the devil they know than the devil they did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was getting seriously depressed because of all the negativity around him and no clear positive future apparent for the Odette School. What had he signed up to as Dean? Lies had been told, and an administration that was very dysfunctional, and an organizational culture that was based on being losers. Rein started to think that his only respectable way out of this job would be a heart attack. Such negative thoughts were scary to Rein and he sort of paniced.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 24 at 1130 Rein saw his general practitioner doctor for his annual check-up. Dr. Zahrebelny informed Rein that he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9chealthy as a horse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Unfortunately, as it turned out he was not a horse doctor. Heart attack symptoms start over the next few days. \\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 27 in the evening Rein felt as if his heart was not functioning properly and went with Mari, via ambulance, to the nearest hospital. They concluded that there was nothing wrong with Rein, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe indigestion?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he was told to go home for the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 29 at 0300 Rein once again felt that his heart was not functioning properly and went with Mari back to Emergency at the Hospital. While on the examining table, with all the equipment and medicine at the ready, the doctors and nurses concluded, once again, that there was nothing wrong with Rein. Some people after the heart attack called what Rein was experiencing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csilent heart attack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, not hat helpful to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttendants and nurses left the room to have a smoke, outside. Rein felt that this time he was going to have a real heart attack and Mari rushed out to get the doctors and nurses. When they returned, apparently all heart monitors were showing that Rein was having a heart attack. They immediately administered a large dose of some super drug, tPA, that had been set at the ready. Apparently, tPA was a clog remover, like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDraino\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that was used for a plugged up \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckitchen sink\\xe2\\x80\\x9d drain. tPA was very powerful (and expensive, C$ 3,500 in 1995) and flushed out arteries that have become clogged and caused the heart attack. \\r\\n\\r\\nTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was the most commonly used drug for thrombolytic therapy. When a patient experienced a stroke or heart attack caused by a blood clot, thromboytic therapy was used to break up/dissolve the clot.\\r\\nBlood clots are the main cause of heart attacks and strokes, so tPA works by dissolving major clots before tissue dies from lack of oxygen. Tissue plasminogen activator is administered intravenously (IV) to patients at the hospital\\xe2\\x80\\x94ideally within three to 4.5 hours after a stroke has occurred. While tPA provides life-saving treatment, it apparently was not safe for every patient.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nRein was lucky, this procedure saved Rein from major heart damage that only actually took place at the bottom of the bottom chamber in his heart. Rein spent the next 10 days in the Intensive Care Unit under observation. \\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 2 Rein underwent an Angiogram that showed that he had two clogged arteries and several others were partly clogged. An Angiogram is conducted by sticking a tube, up an artery in the leg and into the heart. On a TV screen, above the examining bed, everyone could see what was happening (because of a special fluid that had been injected into the blood stream). The doctors had been joking around and then all of a sudden they became quiet and Rein knew that the news was not good. The doctors concluded that Rein could not have Angioplasty to unplug the arteries, whereby a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cballoon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be inserted into the artery and enlarged at the obstruction. Surgery would be the only way to deal with Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problem. Heart surgery unfortunately was much more dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long waiting list for heart surgery at the nearest hospital, the University Hospital in London, Ontario. Only high priority cases could go to surgery before the beginning of January 1996. Rein was considered not to be in the highest priority category. It could be as long as March \\xe2\\x80\\x93 April before Rein received surgery at London University Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 9 Rein went home from the hospital and visited Dr. Zahrebelny, the doctor who knew nothing about horses. He examined Rein and had nothing new to add.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 10 Dr. Susan Lenkei, Toronto General Hospital, was referred by a friend Andy Sarlos to Rein. He asked for her help. She had been his surgeon, when she was younger. Dr. Lenkei contacted surgeon Dr. Menkes in London and she also referred Rein to the best cardiologist in Windsor. Apparently Dr. Lenkei (with her usual Hungarian overbearing) also convinced Dr. Menkes to give Rein an appointment for surgery at the beginning of January. The value of friends and connections was again demonstrated to lucky Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 17 Professor Datta Pillay and Majid (who had experienced heart attacks and were at the Faculty of Engineering, whom Rein had had previous meetings with) tried to help Rein explore alternatives for surgery in the USA. They called Texas and Michigan where some of the best surgeons were located.\\r\\n\\t\\tUS Angioplasty US$ 7,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 13,000\\r\\n\\t\\tUS Surgery        US$ 20,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30,000\\r\\nSuch a surgery could be arranged almost immediately, but would not be covered by OHIP or Greenshield, etc. The total bill would be considerably higher, maybe double, counting hospital stay and any emergencies and transfer of Rein there and back to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 22 Rein went to Ambulatory Care at Windsor Western Hospital for a check-up. \\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 29 Rein had Agina (with severe pains and tightness in the chest).\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 4 Mari drove Rein to the patient registry at the University Hospital in London and to see Dr. Menkes at the Clinic. He confirmed that there were no openings for surgery until January, 1996. Even if a date was promised then, Rein could be bumped by a more serious case arriving, for example, by medical helicopter from Northern Ontario. Upon discussion Menkes said that he would be on holidays part of December and that he would be back at the hospital January 15. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen would it be least likely that a higher priority patient would bump Rein from such an appointment?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The answer was that the first operation, on January 15, when Menkes arrived back from his holidays was a safer bet. Rein asked for the first appointment at 0600, on January 15, and Menkes agreed. Rein stayed at home all of the next four weeks and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to the office. It was not a pleasant wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Menkes prescribed a daily morning walk in the shopping mall (30-40 minutes). No activity after eating. Do not eat too much before bedtime. He expected to conduct surgery on a double or triple by-pass (left & right) plus the internal mammery artery. Such surgery would lower heart attack likelihood for the next 10 years. Surgery risk was from 1 to 97% depending on what he found. Rein was told to expect 2 to 3 months of rehabilitation. He pointed out that males were prone to suffer Anxiety Attacks after surgery \\xe2\\x80\\x93 something that Rein couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand until later to his complete surprise.\\r\\n \\r\\nRein informed the Academic Vice-President Jones of University of Windsor that he ouldl not be available for work until after his surgery. Norman Solomon was appointed Acting Dean. Rein was put on long-term disability benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristmas Holidays were a little different from the usual.\\r\\n\\r\\n1996\\r\\n\\r\\nMad Cow Disease Hits Britain \\r\\nTwo Royal Divorces \\r\\nUnabomber Arrested \\r\\nJanuary 14 Mari and Rein drive to London and stay overnight at the Mount St. Joseph Catholic Seminary dormitory, as recommended by the hospital staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 15 at 0600 Rein went through admitting procedures. He was at peace, totally willing to accept whatever fate awaited him. He had been very fortunate to live a wonderful and fulfilling life. If it was time to go, so be it. He committed his life to God.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 0800 for 5.5 hours Rein undergoes quadruple by-pass surgery with a team of surgeons lead by Dr. Alan Menkis. Original plan was to do a double by-pass surgery, but when they had Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chest open they decided to by-pass two more arteries. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart was stopped for approximately 90 minutes (at approximately the same time, as in Russia, for Boris Yeltsin who went through quintuple by-pass and his heart was stopped for 93 minutes), both Boris and Rein were kept alive by a heart machine, while their hearts were stopped and operated on. Dr. Menkis did a fine job, despite the fact that Boris one-upped Rein with a quintuple. Dr. Menkis would later say that most dangerous moment in the surgery was to see if the heart would start working again and take over from the heart machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein entered the waiting room of the Operating Room, a nurse asked him for his coat, and another one gave him immediately a needle. Subsequently it was difficult to distinguish between reality and a foggy state of mind and Rein remembers nothing about what happened next.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, at some point during the period, from the morning when he arrived, to when he recovered from the drugs, Rein remembers seeing a very bright light at the end of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctunnel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in front of him, that he was entering, while he was unconscious during the operation. It seemed very similar to the near-death experiences described by many people. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarcus Borg (in the book, The Heart of Christianity, p.181) described research that has been done on near-death experiences, as follows: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf people who have been near-death, about 40% report a common pattern: a sense of journeying through a tunnel, a burst of light, a sense of being in the presence of a loving reality, often accompanied by a sense of being out of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body. The last item sometimes included a sense of being able to view one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body from a vantage point beyond the body.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This description ringed somewhat true to Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience. Many consider such near-death experiences as the most reliable evidence that there is an after life, including Marcus Borg, one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foremost Bible scholars. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see if this will be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the operation, Rein spent 6 days in an Intensive Care Unit. His silly ambition became to walk from his bed to the bathroom and to give up the pee plate. After 3 days of trying, he barely managed to do so. The resident doctor happened to see this and asked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you want to go home?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein replied, somewhat mockingly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure!?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mari visited Rein each day driving the 200 miles, back and forth, along \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuicide strip\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a dangerous section of the 401 highway, where transport trucks raced down a straight stretch of road to the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor and Detroit. This was much appreciated by Rein, knowing how much Mari abhorred this stretch of highway.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 21 as suggested by the resident doctor, Rein was discharged from hospital. Alfie Morgan, a friend and professor at University of Windsor drove from Windsor to London in his big old Lincoln car (because of its excellent suspension) to bring Rein home to Windsor. On the way to Windsor, while still in London, Alfie asked whether we had eaten. Rein said no and Alfie surprisingly turned into a Red Lobster franchise restaurant. This was a bit of a shock. Somewhat surreal to be in a restaurant with a lot of fried foods, after the heart traumas. Rein probably was the only one in the restaurant who had a salad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore going for surgery Rein had set up his bedroom so that he could work on his computer skills. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood, this will give me an opportunity to upgrade my computer skills\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Rein remembers thinking. What a silly thought! But upgrade his computer skills he did while recovering at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDezso Horvath repeated his offer for Rein to return to the Faculty of Administrative Studies. During negotiations he agreed to transfer all the Windsor benefits and to try and find an academic chair for Rein, upon his return. This gave Rein an additional excuse to resign. Rein accepted Horvath\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer effective July 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had received no instructions as to how he should go about recovering from the surgery. After care (and for that matter diagnosis of illness) seems to be a skill not practiced very well by the Canadian medical system. But, then there was an unexpected knock on the front door and a lady asked whether Rein had just had surgery and then invited Rein to come to a weekly voluntary support group session at the University of Windsor Field House. Just like an angel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rein had gained some of his strength he started to attend the twice  weekly sessions. There were over 300 people at the Field House, ranging in age from the very young, 24 years old (heart transplant patient), to those who were in their nineties. It was hard to feel sorry for oneself after that. The voluntary ladies were nurses and physiotherapists who taught us how to do exercise and how to take care of ourselves during the recovery period. Rein was encouraged to take up a walking exercise routine with Misty. Voluntary doctors were also in attendance and they admitted that they were learning about rehab. And that is why they were volunteering.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 26 check-up with Dr. Menkes in London. He declared Rein to be OK. But, perhaps jokingly he adds, that he only gives a warranty on his work for 7 years. Bad joke. Obviously an excellent successor to theNapoleon era butcher/surgeons, but with no bedside manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 29 Rein started rehab. At home by trying to walk around block, pedal the exercise bike and do some calisthenics. It was not easy. Misty and Rein barely made it around the block the first time, walking slowly and stopping frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn bike: March 2: 0.75 kilometers. March 8: 2.6 kilometers. March 9: 2.6 kilometers, March 10: 3.2 kilometers, March 11: 1.6 kilometers, etc., etc.\\r\\nKeeping heart beat below 130 bpm.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 19 Rein negotiates with Vice-President Jones a lump sum severance payment from University of Windsor to cover all relocation costs to Toronto and resigns as dean effective July 1. Rein informed Dezso that he was coming back to Schulich \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what a wonderful option from an old friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 28 Rein met with Yves Landry, President of Chrysler Canada and had a discussion about the automobile industry and Landry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns for the Canadian company.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 30 Conference call with Dezso, Terry Purcell and Mark Rittinger about raising money for a Family Business Chair for Rein. Future emphasis on Family Enterprise and Entrepreneurship for the Schulich programme and Rein would again become Director of Entrepreneurial Studies and EWEE.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 31 Rein puts Windsor house on real estate market, which is very thin, especially in the upscale part of Walkerville where we lived at 1144 Devonshire Rd. (Tel. 519-253-7989).\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 19 Stress test on treadmill at Windsor Western Hospital. Rein reaches level 4 with a heartbeat varying from 95 to 166 bpm.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 24 0600 train to Toronto for EWEE Advisory Board meeting. Rein asked to be Executive Director again. Back on 1900 train.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 26 Faculty Council Meeting in Windsor: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stepped down as Dean for health reasons, effective July 1 and have accepted a new Chair in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at Schulich School of Business \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I wish this Faculty and all it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s members God-speed and good fortune. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let anyone tell you the Windsor is the \\xe2\\x80\\x98last chance U\\xe2\\x80\\x99. There are excellent students and faculty members here and an excellent educational programme being delivered to the students.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Fact of the matter, Rein was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrateful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to have a good excuse to resign. He had lost all confidence in getting any future support from the Administration and the willingness of the faculty at Odette School of Business to improve their performance in the short-run.. They were not willing to reach for the stars and were happy with their (low) status quo. Not Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style).\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that day all the plans to reform the university were rejected at an open meeting of the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 4 Mari and Rein rejected first offer to sell Windsor house, not many offers and they are well below asking price. Most people preferred to buy new bungalows in the Windsor suburbs rather than historic buildings in Walkerville.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 10 Ultra-sound, nomography, X-ray, MRI carried out on Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 14 Rein attended City of Windsor Chamber of Commerce, Economic Development Committee Meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 15 - 17 Flew from Detroit International Airport to Boston to attend Babson Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Conference. The idea was to reconnect with his academic research friends now that he was going again to be an academic researcher. Also his friends were very supportive and understood that Rein needed this to boost his morale.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 22 Rein flew to St. Louis to stay with Bob Brockhaus (a well known academic) and his wife.This was done to help Rein recover from depression. We discussed their decision to become involved in the Family Enterprise community as consultants, academics and researchers. This was an option for Rein and Mari upon return to Schulich School of Business. Their supportive ego-stroking was much appreciated. It was reassuring that well known researchers at Babson and Bob Brockhaus affirmed that there was a future for Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career, and that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all over.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 28 Rein flew to Montreal for ASAC/CCMS/CFDMAS Meetings to show the Peterson Flag and to say good-bye to fellow Deans and friends on CFDMAS. He delivered a special address, State of Entrepreneurship Research In Canada, to Quebec academics (he was still very popular in this province because of his Small Business book which was translated to French). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIl faux reculer pour mieux sauter!\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Rein exclaimed \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 We need to recover the passion we had for entrepreneurship in the early days. Today too many researchers are cranking out trivial papers to satisfy the standards of academic journals. We need look at the foundations of entrepreneurship and start developing appropriate theories, publishable or not\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 11 Jenny passed audition to enter Etobicoke School of the Arts. Feng Liu from China, a young faculty member that Rein helped to get a job at Odette, prepared an au revoir dinner for Rein and Mari.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 26 Mari, Jenny and Rein fly to Key West to spend time with Walter and Joanna Schmida. A very nice holiday was enjoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 5 Dezso called to Windsor to confirm final arrangements for Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return to Schulich School of Business. Rein appointed Director of Entrepreneurial Studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral meetings with Alfie Morgan, John Wright and Sue Martin, and other faculty members saying good-bye.

We lived in a beautiful part of Windsor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 22 Jenny leaves for Jodoigne, Belgium to attend school through exchange organized by AFS (until July, 1997).\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 30 Echo cardiogram tests on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart are positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 September 26 EWEE Programme in Toronto. Rein delivered lectures and manages programme as Executive Director. He stays at a visitors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 guest room at York University. On two occasions he is taken by ambulance to Norfinch hospital when he suffers Anxiety Attacks, apparently brought on by being alone in a secluded room. Medicine to counter this was prescribed by Dr. Dymon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 4 Rein and Dezso fly to Montreal to meet with Universalia Consultants who are evaluating EWEE and CIDA who are thinking about not renewing the funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 17 Antares Lennuk arrives at Port Credit Marina by truck from Windsor.  September visits in Toronto by John Wright and Sue Martin and Alfie Morgan.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein founded Family Enterprise Programme, and was elected Chair of Faculty Council again, and he designed a new MBA Course: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManaging the Growing Enterprise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He was commuting back and forth to Windsor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 Sale of 1144 Devonshire Rd closes in Windsor and purchase of 2 Princess of Wales closed in Toronto the next day. Then day after movers arrived at 2 Princess of Wales Court with furniture from Windsor. Romulus and Marta are real troopers and sit in the car while the furniture was moved in. Throughout this period of heart attack and moving again there was not complaining from either of them. They did seem to be a bit overwhelmed by what was happening and trusted us to do what would be best for everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 6 Rein was in automobile accident (intersection of Islington and Kingsway) and ended up in hospital \\xe2\\x80\\x93 concerned about his heart condition. Automobile a total loss as Iranian immigrant runs red light and crashes into Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s automobile right fender/front end, as Rein was making a left turn, after waiting for the light to turn red in the middle of the intersection.

He is granted the deed to some swamp land close to Hamilton that will be set aside as a sanctuary for birds and wildlife. \\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 24 Meeting with Larry Tanenbaum (owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs) who had donated money to Schulich School of Business in the honour of his parents. Rein was the first chairholder of the Anne and Max Tanenbaum Chair in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise. At meeting expectations for the chair were discussed. \\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 19 Rein was back to teaching MGMT 6010 and had his first Phase I meeting with students. Rein started attending Yoga classes. Stress test to monitor progress on heart rehabilitation was positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 20 Mike arrived back from Vancouver. His plans to get involved with the local Vancouver music scene did not work out. \\r\\n\\r\\nGerman Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec met in Prague, and initialled a document in which German apologized for Adolf Hitler\\'s invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Czech Republic expressed regret for the postwar expulsion of Germans from the Sudetenland.  \\r\\n\\r\\n1997 \\r\\nHong Kong Returned to China \\r\\nPathfinder Sends Black Images of Mars \\r\\nPrincess Diana Dies in Car Crash \\r\\nTallest Buildings in the World Built in Kuala Lumpur \\r\\nJanuary 9 Rein to Dr. Lenkei and undergoes an echo cardiogram, with good results.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 21 In Prague, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sign a document acknowledging wrongs each nation committed against each other between 1938 and 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 22 Rein flew to Ottawa for the morning to report on EWEE operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 24 Rein undergoes full day of tests at Toronto Western Hospital for his heart condition with an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExercise Thallium Study\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

It was a very friendly call, as step-brother, wishing Rein good health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 9 Romulus started to visit a Social Worker at Toronto Western Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had many meetings each week with EWEE staff of 6 persons. Rein started process of arranging for Wheeltrans escort for Romulus so that he could go to dialysis 3 times a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 20 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 21 Rein went to Montreal. Ecole Haute Etudes Commericales, Universite de Montreal, for PhD dissertation defense of Robichaux. Rein served as the outside examiner. He sreuggled with his French.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 10, 12, etc. Rein took Romulus to dialysis at Toronto Western. Romulus found the taking of Wheeltrans hard to manage on his own and Rein had to rescue him several times, wherever he became confused and lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 26 Romulus has mental breakdown. The poison that the kidneys and dialysis was supposed to remove affected his brain. Rein was in shower when Mari ran in and shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrandpa is running away!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein thought, at first, that it was a joke. He put on his jeans and t-shirt without drying himself and ran down Princess of Wales Court, after his father, who was screaming at the top of his voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMurderer, Murderer, Murderer \\xe2\\x80\\xa6. My son is trying to kill me. Help, Help, Help \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At end of the crescent was the public school and a yellow school bus was loading young children. Romulus thought that it was a regular bus and tried to get on board and banged on the closed door --- scaring the heck out of everyone. Romulus wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let Rein near him. A lady from the school office tries to calm Romulus down by sitting down with him on the school steps. Finally she crossed the street to Rein and asked him whether she can call the police. Rein replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it is your civic duty --- after all I may be a person who is trying to harm his father\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice arrive shortly. Rein explained his understanding of what was going on. The younger officer started to peruse through the Regulations Book. What can the officers do without arresting Romulus? No one had accused him of any crime. Finally the older officer ordered the younger officer to put the regulations down, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not find anything there to help in this situation!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He then asks Rein what he would like to do. Rein suggests that his father be taken immediately to dialysis and subsequently be admitted into hospital. That is what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that evening Rein went to the hospital to see what was happening to Romulus, who has had dialysis, but continued to be very aggressive and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see Rein. Rein leaves upset and frustrated and leaves a message for Dr. Dymon the family doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Dymon organizes for a Dr. Silverman to see Romulus and prescribe him some medicine. He decides to prescribe an overdose of medicine to shock the kidneys for several weeks and then takes Romulus completely off the medicine. Success! After several weeks Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 kidneys start to function at 25% efficiency, which is sufficient to take him off dialysis. Romulus and Rein were very happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari started discussions on the evening of Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 breakdown as to what to do in the long-run. Mari says she as afraid and too stressed out to continue looking after him. Apparently when Romulus stormed out of the house he had roughly pushed Mari aside and she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think she could handle him in the future. It is decided to see if he could be admitted to a Nursing Home. Rein started to investigate this alternative.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari visit many nursing homes and Romulus was always put on a (long?) waiting list. In his usual manner Rein talks to the nurses on the floor of Elm Grove Living Centre. In one empty room he meets a cleaning lady who informed him that the person in this two-person room had just died this morning. Rein rushed downstairs to meet with the Centre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s director Mrs. Singh. He offered to rent the empty bed immediately and after some negotiation pay for an extra months rent and was offered the room. Rein informed her that he is not sure when Romulus can come to the Centre, but he will nevertheless pay for the bed until Romulus can come. Agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 Rein attends Canadian Association for Family Enterprise (CAF\\xc3\\x89) workshops and delivers a session.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 6 Rein attends Memorial Service for Andy Sarlos, a wonderful man, who has served on the EWEE Advisory Board for many years. He was also the one that recommended Rein to his cardiologist Susan Lenkei. Dr. Lenkei was considered one of the best in Toronto and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take new patients easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 19 Rein and Dezso Horvath fly to New York City for a meeting with a very rich billionaire Hungarian financial investor, George Soros. He agreed to provide US$50,000 support for the EWEE programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 29 Romulus was admitted to Riverdale Long-term Care Hospital, until he stabilized. He still refused to see Rein. But all arrangements were made by Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 June 7 Mari and Rein to Newfoundland for Administrative Sciences Association Canada (ASAC) meetings where Rein presented paper on EWEE. They toured Newfoundland Island which was beautiful. On the way up the North Arm they met a lady moose, who refused to get off the highway. She is protected from all humans, because this is officially in a park. She hasd long slender legs and hoofs that made a clicking sound on the pavement, reminding one of a fancy lady in high heel shoes. Quite a memorable sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 8 Romulus transferred from Riverdale to Elmgrove. He was not happy staying in the two person room, especially since the other person was blind. Who at night has to grope around the room to find the bathroom. This included groping Romulus who was fast asleep. He found this understandably creepy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein started the search for a single room. Mrs. Singh and Rein have become friends and she allocated a single room for him within 2 weeks. Romulus has slowly accepted Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help and is clearly very embarrassed about his behaviour. But he was too proud to apologize or talk about it. This stalemate helped everyone. He accepted his stay in his single room at the nursing home and not at home with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 21 We celebrated Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 89-th birthday in his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwonderful, peaceful, private\\xe2\\x80\\x9d single room. We started the routine of visiting father every Sunday afternoon, after church. We furnished his room with a TV and pictures of people from his past and he watched hockey, but missed his old Montreal Canadiens and wonders where all the old (retired) good players -- whose names he remembers, have gone. He also started to read, profusely, books about the Second World War. Rein searched through every library in Toronto for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cappropriate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d books and they try to discuss, or more correctly, Romulus told him what he thought about the protagonists that he read about. Peace between Romulus and Rein had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to bring Romulus to doctors appointments on the average of once a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 10 Jenny returns home from a year at the Belgian School at Jodoinge, via Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 26 Mari and Rein to Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Rein July 29 to Riga \\xe2\\x80\\x93 July 30/31 Warsaw \\xe2\\x80\\x93 August 1 Vienna \\xe2\\x80\\x93 August 2 Tallinn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 August 9 returned to Toronto.  He was ecruiting participants for EWEE\\xe2\\x80\\x9998 and tried to negotiate personal business opportunities in Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 October 17 EWEE\\xe2\\x80\\x9997 was happening and Rein tought some EWEE sessions and two courses for York.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\r\\nSeptember 21 All participants come to 2 Princess of Wales Court for a pool party and play soccer (with Misty participating) with Rein as referee on the nearby soccer field at the Public School.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 18 Vlad Milek buys \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAntares Lennuk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. She was sold rather quickly for the asking price to a gentleman from Oakville. Rein was surprised as he expected a drawn-out process, and had some initial regrets. It was a sad day. But he was no longer able to handle the stress and adrenolin rush generated from skippering a sailboat single-handedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 10 Scotiabank and the Association of Universities in Canada chose E/WEE as the best university business sector programme in Canada and presented us with Award for the best University-Private Sector Partnership in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 21 Rein: Tot. Cholesterol 3.96 (< 5.20); LDL 2.35 < 2.46: HDL 0.86 (too low on the bottom of safe scale). Rein takes nanny to Dr. Dymon.\\r\\n\\r\\nYear end reports and meetings with EWEE staff, a very busy time administratively, we were getting ready for EWEE\\xe2\\x80\\x9998.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to work with James Darroch to prepare a student team for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoot Corp\\xe2\\x80\\x9d competitions in 1998 at University of Texas in Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 5 Rein made a presentation to the University of Toronto Centre for Russian and East European Studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 18 Christmas Party was held at Elmgrove Living Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\n1998 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan Test Nuclear Weapons \\r\\nU.S. President Clinton Impeached \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 8 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 13 GEM Research Committee Meetings at London Business School, London, UK., Rein visited Karl Moore (former PhD candidate) lecturer at Templeton College, Oxford University.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational Development Research Canada (IDRC) approachedd Rein to lead a two year mission to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile to organize research and development groups that would initiate potential angel investor and venture capitalist meetings with entrepreneurs in the four countries. Rein was asked to work in Argentina (Universidad de Quilmes), in Brazil (PUC-Rio, i.e. Pontificia Universidad e Catolica do Rio de Janeiro), in Chile (First Public Consultants and Universidad Adolfo Ibanez) and in Uruguay (Programa Bolivar and Universidad ORT, Montevideo). The institutions had been chosen by IDRC to act as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for action programmes in each country. This opportunity, presented by S. Tiffen of IDRC, literally knocked on Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office door unexpectedly. Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need any more work, but, given the amount of money involved and the free-hand that we would have, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take rocket science to say, yes I will do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Ostrovski, a Polish born Brazilian, agreed to work with Rein on the project. C. Ostrovski in 1998 with research conducted in Brazil had concluded that there was no shortage of innovative ideas in Brazil that could be commercialized, especially in information and biotechnology. What was lacking were people with skills to commercialize technology and access to both informal and formal venture capital. Also lacking was the necessary supportive infrastructure to develop these ideas into viable businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was to be called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNew Venture Financing Action-Research and Demonstration Project\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The primary output would be the setting up of Venture Forums in country where entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and supporting advisors could meet to discuss entrepreneurial business plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IDRC Project was scheduled to last 2 years and was funded for C$750,000 plus matching grants which each of the countries involved would try to raise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prime contractor was Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro Centre for Technology Development in the Engineering School.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice-Dean Dr. Jose Antonio Baptista-Bueno would be the Director of the overall project.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein was to be the Research Director and responsible for the overall design and the development of all research and direct action programmes. Rein was also responsible for coordinating a Canadian team of advisors.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued weekly Yoga lessons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 3 Rein appointed to the Board of Directors of CdC Corporation, chaired by Alan Hockin. An entrepreneur called Herve De Jordy was starting up a company that would advise entrepreneurs in Toronto. He had visions of franchising the business into other locations eventually. As it turned out, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t listen to his Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 9 Rein to Ottawa for the day to make presentation to Deputy Minister of Industry hoping to raise funds for GEM Canada. Dezso was there for support. No support was offered because the government economists, who were present, had no understanding of the effect of new start-up entrepreneurial businesses on the GNP. They were still hung up on large firms, equilibrium models etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 Ron Titus, consultant, conducted an audit of the EWEE programme for CIDA.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 10 Scotiabank and the Association of Universities and Colleges Canada choose E/WEE Programme for the Award of Excellence (University-Private Sector Partnerships) in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 17 Rein has first Pacemaker operation at 0700. We were all lined up, in a hallway, in beds like at a car wash, waiting for our turn to be operated on. With a local antiseptic, a small \\xe2\\x80\\x9chockey puck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was inserted under the skin, among the muscles of the left shoulder. Two wires were dropped into an artery which carried the wires to the heart. The wires were then attached to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chockey puck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by winding the wires around two terminals on the top. A week before Dr. Lenkei had given Rein a heart monitor, which he wore constantly for 48 hours. Dr. Lenkei, never known for gentle bedside manner, upon reading the results said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRein, you heart beat is dropping below 50 at night. You are a smart man, if it keeps dropping you know what that means! I am ordering a pacemaker for you immediately!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rein didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what a pacemaker was until she found an old model on top of her bookcase. It was larger than the size of a hockey puck, made out of stainless steel and apparently contained a battery operated computer that sent electrical signals to the heart, if the heart slowed down. Dr. Lenkei got immediately on the phone and terrorized all kinds of people at the other endof the telephone (mostly her previous interns and students) until they gave her an immediate operation time on their schedule. Apparently one didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win arguments with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril 24 Jaak Leimann, Minister of Economics, Estonia visits Toronto, Rein eventually wrote an academic article with him and James Gillies: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaking a Successful Transition from a Command to a Market Economy: the lessons from Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, published  in July 2002, International Journal of Corporate Gevernance. \\r\\n\\r\\nJames Darroch mentored Moot Corp. student group in Austin, Texas to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHonourable Mention\\xe2\\x80\\x9d award in an international competition of some 40 universities.

Organized by Gordon Shaw retired professor and friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 18 Rein sailed rented boat around Toronto Islands in the PM.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 24 Rein underwent sleep disorder test and is eventually diagnosed as having a relatively mild case of Sleep Apnia. He is given a special mask, with motor, to put on his face to sleep every night. Rein found the device uncomfortable and ineffective and eventually abandoned the use of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 1 Sze Yee Wong, Hong Kong Chinese teacher and English student arrived for 6 weeks course and stayed with us. A week later Rein rescued fellow student, Stella Chan, who felt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at her Canadian family abode. Both stayed with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 14 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 August 30 IDRC Meetings in Rio de Janeiro. Rein delivered a workshop with the help of James Darroch, C. Ostrovski. Rein also delivered speech to NSF and ICEE Conference paper. Some tourism in Rio and attendance at a Philharmonic Orchestra concert.

Meetings at Univesidad de San Andres and International Small Busness Congress Meetings in Sao Paolo. Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s airplane to Buenos Aires was diverted for 24 hours to Southern Brazil because of severe thunderstorms over River Plate. Rein and Sergio Postigo (UDESA) have a hard time determining what had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 13 Tests for Sleep Apnia concluded that Rein had a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoderate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d case and was given a special breathing machine to use at night. This did not work out and Rein discontinued to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 17 Rein and Dezso to Ottawa to meet with CIDA, who have decided not to fund EWEE in the future. Dezso Horvath and Charles Bassett, Executive Vice President of CIDA get into heated disagreement. On the way home Dezso and Rein discuss funding for a Chair in Family Business from Larry Tanenbaum, in memory of his parents. Rein was to write a proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the past 10 years Schulich School of Business has managed the East-West Entrepreneurship Exchange Programme (EWEE), funded by CIDA, in 17 countries of the former Soviet Union, Baltics and Central Europe. The total funding for the programme had amounted to C$ 13.6 million with 70% matching funds being raised in the private sector. A total of 588 former Soviet block entrepreneurs were placed in Canadian companies during this period for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternships\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to negotiate business relationships. These negotiations were supported by Enterprise York staff who mentored and advised the visiting entrepreneurs on how to prepare business plans and on how to present their ideas to potential investors and partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unclear number of joint ventures resulted from this effort, but we knew that almost all participants improved their positions back home. Some became very rich by starting their own businesses or by getting control of government owned businesses that were privatized. In Estonia two participants became Prime Ministers (Tiit Vahi and Andrus Ansip). Several Estonian participants became government ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Jonathan Levy from London Business school visited York and Entreprise York was invited to join a consortium of countries, with York representing Canada, that would generate data and reports for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). The GEM Consortium had grown to more than 40 countries and generated economic policy recommendations, based on inter-country comparisons. Rein served as Research Director for Canada, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor international comparative research project (1999 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2003). In 2003 the GEM leadership was passed on to HEC Professor Nathaly Riverin in Montreal, who had helped Rein with studies in Quebec.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember 27 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 29 Rein went to Edmonton to represent Deszo Horvath as Dean of the Schulich School of Business at Federation of Canadian Deans of Business Meetings. \\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 2 Ron Mulholland successfully defended his dissertation: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cContext Matters: Industry and Firm Size Affect Managerial Decision Making and Overconfidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

A big and fat Oligarth attached Rein as to why he needed corporate governance because he owns and runs everything. Rein responded by reminding him that he now has subsidiaries. Do you trust everyone who is running your subsidiaries? The oligarth offered Rein a job, perhaps jokingly. Rein declined.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein invited as Visiting Professor, the Instituto Superior De Administracao at the Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana in Curitiba, Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 September 3 Rein travelled to Buenos Aires and was asked to serve as advisor to the Rector, Universidad de San Andres (UDESA), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein served as first Visiting Professor of the Karel Steuer Chair (1998 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2001) that he helped to set up at the Universidad de San Andres, Buenos Aires. At UDESA, a relatively small liberal arts college, 500 students, the newly appointed rector was willing to make Entrepreneurship as a major for all students and to promote entrepreneurship in Argentina. He was impressed with the programme at Babson College, where Rein had held the Paul D. Babson Chair (1986 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1987) in Wellesly, Massachussetts, USA). \\r\\n\\r\\nRein met with most of the members of the ACEESA Board individually and tried to convince them that a differentiation strategy based on teaching entrepreneurship would be desirable for their relatively new subsidiary. UDESA. Such a reorientation would have been funded by entrepreneur Francisco de Narvaez, who had just sold his family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supermarket company, TIA, the largest in Argentina, to French multi-national company Carrefors. Francisco had some political ambitions and hoped that entrepreneurship would be seen as a way of reenergizing the Argentine economy. He saw this also as a possible way of helping his political ambitions. \\r\\nThe ACEESA Board, was used to running a private school for younger children, originally set up by the British more than 100 years ago. They were all stodgy, well established gentlemen, who were not willing to change the way things had always been done for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversidad de San Andres was losing money because it could not differentiate itself in a small market of older children of the wealthy middle class elite of Argentinian families. Rein had calculated that UDESA needed to grow to at least 1,200 students to break-even. The major reorientation and growth objective were supported by the new rector Sanz, but, after 3 years, he was eventually fired by a conservative Board, with whom he had also other disagreements. Entrepreneurship continued as a specialization only and UDESA continued to lose money, with sizable deficits paid for by the Board who also controlled the successful English-style private school for                grades K to 11. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe eventual major collapse of the Argentinian economy was the major factor that stopped the Entrepreneuship Strategy proposal. The Peso that had been pegged to the US Dollar at 1:1 and it eventually collapsed to 1:10. World financial institutions, like the International Monetary Fund, recalled their loans made to the Argentinian state.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 26 Romulus may have had a stroke? This was never clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 4 - Dec. 1 Rein stayed at UDESA, San Andres, until his contract ran out because of the collapse of the Peso.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 9 Jouralista Natalia Scomparin and 3 ACEESA Directors invited Rein to dinner in Buenos Aires.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 17 Rein met with Jorge Sainz at Hotel Esmeralda at 0900 and dinner 1700 with Leandro Alen to discuss the failure of the Entrepreneurship Strategy proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 20 Meeting was held at 0800 with Jorge Sainz at Esmeralda.  At 1930 a meeting also with Gabriel and Sergio took place at the same place.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 21 Rein met with Francisco de Narvaez regarding writing a case on Tia, the company he owned. Mari left Toronto on Canadian Airlines for BsAs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNov. 23 Final Business Plan presented by Rein to Francisco de Narvaez. Dinner meeting with was hosted by Francisco and with Jorge Sainz and Mari.\\r\\n\\r\\nSergio Postigo and Gabriel offered on behalf of Francisco to pay for a one week holiday for Mari and Rein in Chile, fly fishing at a private resort. They apparently had made reservations already. Rein tried to make reservations to fly to Coyhaique, Chile, the nearest airport, where somebody was going to pick up Mari and Rein in a four wheel drive jeep. Rein was unsuccessful to find a flight to such a small airport on time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco de Narvaez offered to lend us one of his two Lear jets to fly us to Coyhaique Balmaceda Airport and to pick us up on December 1. When Rein objected to Francisco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind offer, Francisco replied that he had 2 Lear jets and this two-man team of pilots needed to keep their flight hours up to some standard. That was an example of a rich man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chivalry. Thanks!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met our private jet at the San Fernando Airport and they flew us to the Coyhaique Balmaceda Airport, Chile. Coyhaique was a small city in Chile\\'s Ays\\xc3\\xa9n Region, known as a gateway to remote parts of (Chilean) Patagonia. Crossed by trails, rocky Cerro (Nountain) McKay looms over the city. On the outskirts was the trout-filled Simpson River.\\xc2\\xa0We met our driver and were taken to a lodge at Lago Frio. What distinguishes Coyhaique from an angler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective are the 500 bodies of fishable water within roughly two hours drive of the town square, comprising several main rivers and hundreds of creeks and lakes teeming with wild trout. Note the English names. Chile currently has the largest population descendants of British in Latin America. Over 700,000 Chileans may have British ancestry. British investment has helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen have helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Several Chilean  heros, with British names, are evident in Southern Chile. In1810, Bernardo O\\'Higgins joined the revolt against the French dominated Spanish government, which lead to Chile\\xe2\\x80\\x99s independence.\\xc2\\xa0The liberal-socialist \"Revolution of 1891\" introduced political reforms modeled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lived in a large cottage with 8 guest rooms and a common dining room. Every morning Rein was taken by a guide into the river fishing waters wearing fly fishing gear and a fly rod. Mari preferred to enjoy the remote scenary all around us. Rein, nor the guide, were able to catch any fish. But Rein learned how to flyfish and enjoyed the adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent 3 days exploring nearby (Argentinian) Patagonia in a four wheel jeep. There were no roads and we drove across vast grass lands that seemed to be badly in need of rain. When we came to a fence we carefully lifted the wooden fence gate and replaced it after passing through. The fences marked farms that had dominated the prairies of Patagonia, and were now abandoned, because the European families became too old and unable to manage the poor years of rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been substantial migrations from Wales during the periods 1880-87, and also 1904-12, mainly due to depression within the coalfields. The settlers had seemingly achieved their utopia with Welsh speaking schools and chapels; even the language of local government was Welsh in Patagonia.\\r\\nIn the few decades since the settlers had arrived, they had transformed the inhospitable scrub-filled semi-dessert into one of the most fertile and productive agricultural areas in the whole of Argentina. They expanded their territory into the foothills of the Andes with a settlement known as Cwm Hyfryd in Chubut, a\\xc2\\xa0province\\xc2\\xa0in southern\\xc2\\xa0Argentina, situated South of the 42-nd parallel.\\xc2\\xa0By 1915 the population of Chubut had grown to around 20,000, with approximately half of these being foreign immigrants. \\xc2\\xa0In the early 21st century, it was estimated that around 50,000 Patagonians were of Welsh descent.\\r\\nThe Patagonian desert has hosted various\\xc2\\xa0indigenous peoples\\xc2\\xa0in its past, as evidenced by\\xc2\\xa0cave paintings\\xc2\\xa0in the area that we visited. They often consisted of arranged hand palms that had been dipped in some sort of dye and pressed on cave walls. They apparently were a record of family history (similar to the Totem Poles in Western Canada). The earliest inhabitants of the desert known are those of the\\xc2\\xa0Tehuelche\\xc2\\xa0complex. Tehuelches lived as\\xc2\\xa0hunter-gatherers\\xc2\\xa0and did not practise agriculture in lush valleys found in the desert. \\r\\nIn the few decades before and after 1900 the less dry parts of the Patagonian steppe experienced a sheep farming boom, transforming the region into one of the world\\'s greatest exporters of ovine products. This is what attracted the Welsh to Patagonia.\\r\\nThe area is sparsely populated today and those that do live here, barely survive mainly by the raising of some livestock such as sheep and goats. Recently a volcanic eruption in Chile had covered much of Patagonia and the livestock, particularly, the sheep herds with volcanic dust that ruined their fur as a product. The old Irish couple, man and woman, in whose obviously former fancy old hacienda we stayed in, were in a disasterous shape as a commercial entity. It seemed that the old couple was just waiting out their time, alone, until they would die.\\r\\nAt the end of our stay we were picked up by Francisco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private Lear jet at Balmaceda Coyhaique Airport and flown to the airport at San Fernando. We were the only passangers in the isolated airport.\\r\\nOn landing in San Fernando Airport, Sergio came running onto the tarmark, obviously with bad news. Apparently Romulus had died at the nursing home while we were in Coyhaique.\\r\\nDec. 1 Mari and Rein flew back to Toronto and visited the Elmgrove Centre.We discovered that Michael had come from Ottawa to identify the body. According to Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 favourite nurse, he had been struggling to walk with his walker and was determined to walk to the breakfast table without assistance. Once he did so, he finished his breakfast and returned to his room and lay down and died, peacefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 16 Mari and Rein went to Montreal, by airplane, with the urn, for the burial of Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ashes next to his second wife Alma at the Estonian portion of the cemetery at Dollard des Ormeaux.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2001\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge W.

Within days, Islamic militant\\xc2\\xa0Osama bin Laden\\xc2\\xa0and the\\xc2\\xa0al-Qaeda terrorist network\\xc2\\xa0were identified as the parties behind the attacks.

Innsbruck is nestled in between two Alpine mountain ranges. The Brenner Pass, was an easily crossed path through the Alps, and made the position of the town a strategic location. Because of the importance of protecting the Alpine pass, the Roman soldiers originally set up a military town. Roman control ceded to a Bavarian invasion in the 6th century. The Bavarians continued to rule for several hundred years until 1027. A thriving market and the Inn bridge were constructed in 1187. This gave the town a new economic status and the present day name of Innsbruck, meaning bridge over the Inn River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reign of the Hapsburgs, began in 1363, and ushered in a new age of glory for Innsbruck. Emperor Maximilian I named Innsbruck as the capitol of Tyrol Province, and took the already flourishing city and increased its prestige and power over the region. As a legacy, he left a golden roof. A shining architectural feature composed of thousands of copper tiles. Out of his hotel window Rein could see the magnificient architecture, every morning before going to work at the University.\\r\\nWhat made Salzburg so great was how intimate it was and everything was in such close proximity. Austria\\'s fourth largest city occupies an idyllic setting straddling the Salzach River set between two imposing mountains. The city has given rise to at least three musical world phenomena - the genius of composer Wolfgang Mozart, the 1965 movie \"The Sound of Music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and the composition of Silent Night.  It is a true old Baroque City with many window flower boxes being cared for by local housekeepers.\\r\\nAbove the rooftops of the downtown sits the world-famous Hohensalzburg Fortress. We enjoyed an exquisite menu before a concert\\xc2\\xa0in the historic premises of the Panorama Restaurant. Afterwards, we were treated to\\xc2\\xa0an unfogettable concert in the Golden Hall or Castle Hall\\xc2\\xa0with the most beloved works of the greats being played, from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to Strauss. To our surprise the two main performers were a couple from Estonia.\\r\\nThe fortress, Schloss Leopoldskron, up on the mountainside is where parts of the Sound of Music were filmed. But most important, Salzburg was the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born here on 27 January 1756.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart traveled so extensively as both a child and an adult that almost wherever you go, we find places that claim he lived or worked there. In the middle of the 1800\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, the Royal Prussian Court Chapel in Berlin contacted the Benedictine Monastery in Salzburg to ask who in Salzburg might have written\\xc2\\xa0Silent Night. Even after\\xc2\\xa0Silent Night\\xc2\\xa0had become well known in the world and especially in Europe, no one seemed to know who composed it. \\xc2\\xa0It turned out that its\\xc2\\xa0librettist was a\\xc2\\xa0Joseph Mohr\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0composer,\\xc2\\xa0a Franz Xaver Gruber. In the former St. Nicholas Church, in Salzburg, on 24 December, 1818 the Christmas carol was performed for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something magical about it, when you felt music history come to life and then heard performances in famous concert and opera houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nVienna apart from being regarded as the\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCity of Music\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is also said to be \"The City of Dreams\" because it was home to the world\\'s first psycho-analyst \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\xc2\\xa0Sigmund Freud. We visited the offices of Freud and found them Spartan and the genius of Freud was clear from the relics. \\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city\\'s roots lie in settlements that transformed Vienna into a\\xc2\\xa0Medieval, Baroque\\xc2\\xa0city, and then the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque castles and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstra\\xc3\\x9fe lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks. It would take a lot of space to describe Vienna\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution to culture and we are not going to attempt it. Some of the history of famous musicians was captured by visiting the CENTRAL CEMETERY (ZENTRALFRIEDHOF).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composers Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Johann Strauss senior, Johann Strauss junior, his brothers Eduard and Josef, Josef Lanner, Carl Michael Ziehrer, Johannes Brahms, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Antonio Salieri, Arnold Schoenberg, Robert Stolz, Emmerich K\\xc3\\xa1lm\\xc3\\xa1n, Hugo Wolf, Franz von Supp\\xc3\\xa9 and Karl Mill\\xc3\\xb6cker are all buried here and there is a monument to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. All of them found Vienna a wonderful environment to be creative.\\r\\n\\r\\nVienna State Opera House opened on May 25, 1869 with Mozart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon Giovanni\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and has enjoyed a first class reputation in the music world ever since. Mari and Rein couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get tickets to the State Opera and attended a wonderful consert at the Burgtheater. After the Com\\xc3\\xa9die Francaise, the Burgtheater in Vienna is Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second-oldest theatre. Mari and Rein also attended the newly revitalized Orangery Schoenbrunn, the largest interior garden including a hothouse for overwintering tender citrus trees.It served as host for the Vienna Schoenbrunn Palace Concerts. Every evening the Schoenbrunn Palace Orchestra, accompanied by renowned singers and ballet dancers, performs the most famous works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart und Johann Strauss.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938, after a triumphant and forceful entry into Austria, called the\\xc2\\xa0Anschluss, Austrian-born\\xc2\\xa0Adolf Hitler\\xc2\\xa0spoke, self-servedly, to the\\xc2\\xa0Austrian Germans\\xc2\\xa0from the balcony of the Neue Burg, a part of the\\xc2\\xa0Hofburg\\xc2\\xa0at the\\xc2\\xa0Heldenplatz. Hofburg Palace\\xc2\\xa0was the former imperial palace in the centre of\\xc2\\xa0Vienna,\\xc2\\xa0Austria. Part of the palace forms the official residence and workplace of the\\xc2\\xa0President of Austria. (Schoenbrunn, above, was the emperor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s summer place). Built in the 13th century and expanded in the centuries since, the palace has housed some of the most powerful people in European and\\xc2\\xa0Austrian history. Between 1938 and the end of the\\xc2\\xa0Second World War, Vienna lost its status as a capital to\\xc2\\xa0Berlin,\\xc2\\xa0as Austria ceased to exist and became a part of\\xc2\\xa0Nazi Germany. It was not until 1955 that Austria regained full sovereignty. Traditional Vienna free wheeling creativity was quashed during the Nazi period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Republic of Venice (Veneto)\\xc2\\xa0was a major maritime power during the\\xc2\\xa0Middle Ages\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Renaissance, and a\\xc2\\xa0staging area\\xc2\\xa0for the\\xc2\\xa0Crusades\\xc2\\xa0and the Battle of Lepanto. The latter was fought entirely between\\xc2\\xa0galleys, in October 7, 1571 in which a fleet of the\\xc2\\xa0Holy League prevented the Ottoman Empire from expanding further West along the European side of the Mediterranean.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nVenice was a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain, spice, and art) from the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of\\xc2\\xa0Antonio Vivaldi and\\xc2\\xa0Claudio Monteverdi.  Venice became part of the\\xc2\\xa0Kingdom of Italy\\xc2\\xa0in 1866, following a referendum held as a result of the\\xc2\\xa0Third Italian War of Independence. \\r\\n\\r\\nConcerts in Venice offered more than just beautiful music. Generations of composers, artists, and architects contributed to the unique atmosphere of Venice\\'s stunning performance venues. Mari and Rein shared 4 days of classical music concerts in the \\'Floating City\\', via vaporettos a popular water taxi or waterbus in Venice, Italy. There are 19 scheduled lines that serve locales within Venice, and travel between Venice and nearby islands. \\r\\n\\r\\nMari and Rein went to the island of Murano. The artisans of Murano are still employing centuries-old techniques, crafting everything from contemporary\\xc2\\xa0art glass\\xc2\\xa0and glass\\xc2\\xa0figurines\\xc2\\xa0to Murano\\xc2\\xa0chandeliers and\\xc2\\xa0wine stoppers. We bought a very special fancy wine glass from one of the artisans for US$400. It is a unique glass that was used by Mari and Rein for special celebrations between the two, for example, NewYear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eve.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari and Rein spent 4 days, day and night, travelling via vaporetto, back and forth, to concerts of Vivaldi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s music, which was our favourite composer. There was no shortage of concerts, everywhere, until the midnight hour.\\r\\n \\r\\nBesides Vivaldi, Venice is known as the home of several other well known artists, such as Albinoni,\\xc2\\xa0Galuppi,\\xc2\\xa0Marcello,\\xc2\\xa0Tartini, Monteverdi,\\xc2\\xa0and Gabrieli.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of Monteverdi in opera was best known to us. The Basilica of San Marco, one of the most recognizable buildings in the world, has had choirmasters since 1318, including names such as\\xc2\\xa0Claudio Monteverdi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social function of the opera and the timing of the opera season in Venice go hand in hand.\\xc2\\xa0Carnevale\\xc2\\xa0is a time of the year when Venice is an international meeting ground, a time when matters besides music were discussed, even at the opera. Theaters were always forums for the rich and powerful to discuss the present and the future of the\\xc2\\xa0Venetian Republic\\xc2\\xa0in its wars against the Turks, for example.\\r\\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi; (4 March 1678\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 28 July 1741) is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental\\xc2\\xa0concertos, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty\\xc2\\xa0operas. His best-known work is a series of\\xc2\\xa0violin concertos\\xc2\\xa0known as\\xc2\\xa0The Four Seasons.\\r\\nIn 1693, at the age of fifteen, he began studying to become a\\xc2\\xa0priest. He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed\\xc2\\xa0il Prete Rosso, \"The Red Priest\".\\xc2\\xa0(Rosso\\xc2\\xa0is Italian for \"red\", referred to the color of his hair, a family trait.)\\r\\nVivaldi composed many operas in his time, but he never reached the prominence of other great opera composers. His most successful operas were\\xc2\\xa0La costanza trionfante\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Farnace. Vivaldi\\'s celebrated concertos, The Four Seasons, are among the most popular works of all time and these, with the rest of the concertos in Op. 8, represent the composer\\'s remarkable innovations in the field of the Baroque concerto\\r\\nMany of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the\\xc2\\xa0Ospedale della Piet\\xc3\\xa0, a home for abandoned female children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a\\xc2\\xa0Catholic priest) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Like most composers of the time, Vivaldi went to Vienna to stage popular operas, and he took up residence near the\\xc2\\xa0K\\xc3\\xa4rntnertortheater. The K\\xc3\\xa4rntnertortheater was for many years the centre of opera in Vienna. Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished and died during the night of 27/28 July 1741, aged 63.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 15 RCGP lectures started at facilities rented from Ryerson.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeptember 29 State prosecutors of Dortmund, Germany, charge eleven former German officers with the murder of 5,000 Italian prisoners-of-war on the Greek island of Cephalonia during World War II.

The hype of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew economy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came back down to earth. Major international meetings were marred by violent antiglobalisation protests.

In Bordeaux we toured the various winery sites and producers. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or\\xc2\\xa0ch\\xc3\\xa2teaux. There are 54\\xc2\\xa0appellations\\xc2\\xa0of Bordeaux wine. The wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-1st century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\xc2\\xa0Bordeaux wine\\xc2\\xa0is any\\xc2\\xa0wine\\xc2\\xa0produced in the Bordeaux region of\\xc2\\xa0France, centred on the city of\\xc2\\xa0Bordeaux\\xc2\\xa0and covering the whole area of the\\xc2\\xa0Gironde\\xc2\\xa0Departement, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares,\\xc2\\xa0making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \"claret\"), with sweet white wines (most notably\\xc2\\xa0Sauternes), dry whites, and in much smaller quantities ros\\xc3\\xa9 and sparkling wines (Cr\\xc3\\xa9mant\\xc2\\xa0de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. \\r\\n\\r\\nMari and Rein visited a chateaux, where apparently they thought we were very famous clients, who apparently also had an appointment, and so they gave us a personal tour. We bought 2 bottles of the local Bordeaux for $40 each, which was the most we could spend. The world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most expensive bottle of wine that could actually be drunk was also the most expensive wine ever sold in America, a Montrachet 1978 from Domaine de la Roman\\xc3\\xa9e-Conti that was hammered down at\\xc2\\xa0Sotheby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xc2\\xa0in New York in 2001. The lot of seven bottles fetched $167,500, or $23,929 per bottle.\\xc2\\xa0It boggles the mind to guess what our two bottles, begrudgingly bought, were not really worth. We waited 5 years to drink our precious wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 15 Mari and Rein visited Villem Lohuaru and Salme at Horseshoe Valley Ski Resort, North of Barrie, where they had a home. In the early 1960s, Villem and Salme Lohuaru, a home builder from the Toronto area were looking for a site to build a ski resort and settled on Horseshoe Valley. At the time it was locally known as Hungry Hollow, due to its elevation, and natural \"U\" shape facing west toward the proximite Georgian Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nLohuaru, Villem (Founder and developer of Horseshoe Valley Resort, Oro Township) died at his home in Barrie on Friday, August 24, 2012, in his 98th year.  Salme died on January 7, 2014, in her 95-th year. Romulus called Villem his \\xe2\\x80\\x9clast best friend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Most of Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acquaintances had passed away and he found this hard to accept. Villem and Romulus met at the Geislingen Displaced Persons Camp, after the War. They were introduced when Romulus helped Villem rent a truck to haul some of his goods for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 18 Jennifer-Mai Charlotte Peterson graduated from Etobicoke School of the Arts. Etobicoke School of the Arts (ESA) was a specialized, public arts-academic high school located in Toronto, Canada. Founded on September 8, 1981, Etobicoke School of the Arts had the distinction of being the oldest, free standing arts-focused high school in Canada.

At the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. \\xc2\\xa0Men, women and children were once killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn\\'t that long ago, one thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez.

This was a very expensive race and that is why Swiss billionaires won the Cup in 2007 aboard Allenghi, repeating from the last time they were held. While in New Zealand we saw several of the old America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cup boats in Auckland and Queenstown.\\r\\n\\r\\nRotorua is the heartland of New Zealand Maori culture, and visitors have the opportunity to experience the warm spirit of Te Maori. We attended a Maori feast. Rotorua, a Maori word meaning literally \"second lake\", was originally settled by the Maori of the Te Arawa iwi. Many famous Maori legends and stories are based in this area including Hinemoa and Tutanekai\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps New Zealand\\'s most famous love story. The founder of Rotorua was a Maori explorer named Ihenga in the 14th century. The first Maori inhabitants arrived shortly after his discovery, transported by canoe from Hawaiki in Eastern Polynesia. (In Polynesian mythology, Hawaiki is the original home of the Polynesian peoples, before dispersal across Polynesia). \\r\\n\\r\\nA truly unique land, Australia is the world\\'s sixth largest country and its smallest, flattest continent. It\\'s about the same size as the 48 mainland states of the USA and 50 per cent larger than Europe, but has the lowest population density in the world - only two people per square kilometre. An intriguing contrast of vast, open landscapes and sophisticated, vibrant cities, Australia is a popular travel destination due to its many tourist attractions, remarkable wildlife and beautiful beaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Ancient Land,\\xc2\\xa0Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Aboriginal people are thought to have arrived here by boat from South East Asia during the last Ice Age, at least 50,000 years ago. At the time of European discovery and settlement, up to one million Aboriginal people lived across the continent as hunters and gatherers. They were scattered in 300 clans and spoke 250 languages and 700 dialects. Each clan had a spiritual connection with a specific piece of land. However, they also travelled widely to trade, find water and seasonal produce and for ritual and totemic gatherings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1770 Captain James Cook chartered the east coast of Australia and claimed it for Britain, who settled the country as a penal colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nPort Arthur, Tasmania, Australia started as a timber station in 1830; it is best known today for having been an experimental penal colony. The English prison reformer, Jeremy Bentham, described his Peniteniary as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca machine for grinding rogues honest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The cogs of this machine were discipline and punishment, religious and moral instruction, classification and separation, training and education. Each building, each garden, each fence and pathway played its part in this relentless machine. Its methods seem cruel today, and many men were broken. This was the beginnings of the modern welfare system and the modern asylum. Increasingly, as time passed, it housed the wreckage of the convict system, men too physically or mentally disabled to look after themselves. But some men did leave equipped for a future that they could not otherwise have dreamed of. The penal system finally closed in 1877. While Australia itself was started as a penal colony by the British, today the highest status families in Australia try to trace their ancestry back to some convict (usually presented as having been falsely accused).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian economy has been ranked as most resilient in the world five times since 2002 and ranked inside the top 10 of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most resilient economies since 2008 by the World Competitive Yearbook of the International Institute for Management Development. A thriving democracy, Australia is one of the most politically and economically stable nations in the world. Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major cities function as regional headquarters for more than 850 multinational corporations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe visited the cities of Sydney, Cairns, Melbourne, Hobart Tasmania, Launceston, Melbourne, Aukland, and, Papeete. Then we flew home to Toronto via Los Angeles.\\r\\n\\r\\nPapeete is French Polynesia\\'s capital and center of business, its population is reported to be between 90 -120,000 people, depending on where the city limit is defined, It accounts for well over half of the Island of Tahiti\\'s overall population of 180,000 people. \\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Pomare Vahine IV was the most illustrious sovereign of Tahiti and reigned for half a century.\\xc2\\xa0 When she died in 1877, she was succeeded by one of her sons who became PomareV.\\xc2\\xa0 He was the king who donated his islands to France in 1880 and died the same year Gauguin arrived in Tahiti, in 1891.\\xc2\\xa0 The Pomare dynasty is now extinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nTahiti and Moorea, part of the\\xc2\\xa0Society Islands\\xc2\\xa0of \\xc2\\xa0French Polynesia, were first explored by Captains Cook and Bligh, but they were made truly famous by the paintings of the artist, Paul Gauguin, and by the words of author, James A. Michener.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1866, the Tahitian legislative assembly voted for French legislation proposed by the governor. Up until 1880 France exercised her sovereignty over the Marquesas Islands and by the beginning of the twentieth century, her empire included all of the archipelagos now called French Polynesia. At the time of the French protectorate, the central structure of Tahitian administration was composed of the royal court, the Assembly and the district councils. French authority was represented by the governor, assisted by diverse officers and civil servants. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe French painter and sculptor Paul Gauguin (1848-1903), seeking exotic environments, first in France and later in Tahiti, combined the people and objects in his paintings in novel ways, evoking a mysterious, personal world. When Gauguin arrived in Tahiti, he did not settle in the capital, Papeete, which contained too many Europeans for his liking. He preferred to live like a native some 25 miles away. He took a native girl as his wife, and she bore him a son.   \\r\\n                                          \\r\\nTo Rein the paintings were beautiful from the first time he saw them in the late 1950s in Montreal. Tiiu first introduced the art to a na\\xc3\\xafve Rein. The paintings were a combination of colours that reflected the nature around the painter, that captured Rein. Gauguain themes were simple and almost always of the peole in the village where he lived. His paintings documented the life on Tahiti before the French administration came. This became what Rein day dreamed about.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII and poor, Gauguin returned to France in August 1893, where to his delight he found that he had inherited a small sum from an uncle. In Paris he lived with flair, accompanied much of the time by a Javanese girl named Annah, who later disappeared with the contents of his studio. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn 1895 he sailed for Tahiti in the spring. He settled once again among the natives, this time in the north. His health grew poorer; and an ankle he had broken did not heal properly, and he suffered from syphilis and strokes. He was harassed by the government authorities, whom he flounted, but upon whom he had to also depend for menial jobs in order to support himself. In 1901 he moved to the Marquesas Islands, where he died, alone, of a stroke on May 8, 1903. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the main island there is a museum of Gauguin paintings about 25 miles from Papeete in an impressive (but apparently abandoned) building, which was open to nature and it was never quite clear whether you were inside or out in the elements. His famous paintings nowadays hang in the most famous galleries of the world. But Rein is afraid, that the Tahiti paintings he had found, would deteriorate over time.\\r\\n \\r\\nCaptain Bligh. Bligh, the captain of the sailing ship, Bounty, was a victim of the most famous mutiny in history. The surviving crew had a very strong influence on the Tahitian people during their five month stay in 1789. Fletcher Christian, the mutineer, decided to set out to discover another island. With a mere eight companions and a few Tahitians, Christian founded the population of the island of Pitcairn, where his family members continue to live today. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixteen sailors who stayed on Tahiti changed the course of Tahitian history, thanks to their weapons and their willingness to take military action in local wars. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tahiti there is a monument to the men of the Bounty, located close to Gauguin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gallery. We drove the ring road around the island (country) in 2.5 hours. Mari bought an oval black (greenish, depending on the light) pearl to put on a chain, which had been locally grown and made. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2006 \\r\\n\\r\\nA Danish newspaper challenged taboos against illustrations of Muhammad by printing several negative cartoons depicting him.\\r\\nA stampede during the Stoning of the devil ritual on the last day at the Hajj in Mina, Saudi Arabia, killed 362 Muslim pilgrims.\\r\\nSaddam Hussein was found hiding in a hole in the ground, charged on\\xc2\\xa0May 15th\\xc2\\xa0and following the trial was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging.\\r\\nThe Iranian Leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies that the Holocaust ever existed.\\r\\nViolence erupts, during the holy month of Ramadan, between Shia and Sunni Muslims leaving many dead on both sides.\\r\\nPresident Bush acknowledged that secret CIA prisons existed around the world outside of US legal jurisdiction.\\r\\nThe Qu\\xc3\\xa9b\\xc3\\xa9cois nation motion is passed by the House of Commons in the Parliament of Canada.\\r\\nJan. 16 Rein taught ENT 860 classes at Ryerson, jointly with David Valliere.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan 18 - Mar. 15 Rein taught ENTR 4900 at Schulich.\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 18 Mari and Rein took a Trip to Cuba: Havana \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Cienfuegos - Santa Clara \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trinidad de Cuba \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Camaguez \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bayamo \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Santiago de Cuba \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe travelled by tourist van, operated by a new aspiring entrepreneur, down the main highway to Santiago de Cuba. Founded by the Spanish in 1515, the city is known for colonial architecture and Castro-led revolutionary history. The city\\'s distinctive Afro-Cuban cultural influences were on display. Santiago seemed clearly more steeped in yesterday, than Havana, which had aspirations to be an elegant city, again. On both sides of the highway were large farms and corn seemed to be harvested by large out of date machinery.\\r\\n(On July 31, 2006, Fidel Castro will pass power on a provisional basis to his younger brother, military chief Raul Castro, after serious internal bleeding forced him to undergo emergency surgery and begin a slow convalescence. The transfer of authority, will occur shortly before Fidel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 80th birthday on August 13, 2005 marked the first time Fidel Castro had relinquished any control since the 1959 revolution.)                                         \\r\\n\\r\\nA sense of societal relaxation was evident in all the parts of the country that we visited.This was particularly evident to Rein, as professor, at the Universidad de la Habana (with 15 colleges)\\xc2\\xa0among the students he spoke to. Like students elsewhere they seemed to be equally liberal minded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was surprisingly evident was the medical competency of Cuban doctors. Mari was ill and was treated quickly and effectively at our motel. No fee was charged for service or medicine. Cuban doctors are trained at Cuban Universities, e.g. ELAM (Latin American School of\\xc2\\xa0Medicine);\\xc2\\xa0University\\xc2\\xa0of\\xc2\\xa0Havana. Doctors are paid a fixed (low) salary per month. Their services are ardently recruited by poor socialistic countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased security measures were reported in major cities in the days \\r\\nfollowing the transfer of power, including the deployment of military personnel to prevent possible public demonstrations. During our tours we saw no evidence of this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOfficial corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x9d remained a serious problem, apparently, according to journalists, but was not evident to Mari or Rein. A culture of illegality did shroud the mixture of private and state-controlled economic activities that were now tentatively allowed on the island. Many entrepreneurs and government bureaucrats and police seemed to be unsure as to what was now allowed and what was not. Capitalism was clearly about to break out.The Cuban government forecast an economic growth rate of 10 percent for 2007, slightly lower than the 12.5 percent growth reported in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe strolled for miles along the famous Malec\\xc3\\xb3n, Havana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legendary seaside boulevard. We visited Ernest Hemingway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home and his favourite bar. We had dinner where the Flamenco dancers tried to do their best. We walked the ancient cobblestone streets of Old Havana, where many stately mansion houses were under extensive restoration.The streets seemed to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9clittered\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with US automobiles from the 1950s. But they all seemed to be working well enough to create traffic jams and auto horns were continually being sounded. Most of these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cantique autos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seemed to have been rejuvenated or refurbished with non-original parts and d\\xc3\\xa9cor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not visit the new tourist area of Arroyo Bermejo Beach. According to Jennifer and Ontang, the hotels were not the top rated quality ones. The beach was apparently filled with the usual tourist rabble. They were not satisfied with their quasi \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican\\xe2\\x80\\x9d holiday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 7 Rein met with Wendy Cukier, Associate Dean, Faculty and later Vice-President at Ryerson, on giving feedback on her academic paper. Rein did a radical editing of her paper and said it was not ready/worth to be published in an academic journal. Rein refused an offer to be a co-author.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 14 Meeting with D. Valliere at Orwell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pub on joint paper we were writing.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein spent a large amount of time working for RCGP writing and editing cases and research articles of Russian academics who attended the RCGP for submission to a Special Issue of Corporate Governance: An International Journal. With the help of Dr. Bob Tricker in England who had previously served as Editor-in-Chief, but was now retired. Six articles and three cases were edited by Rein and then Bob Tricker. But, after Bob retired the new editor decided not to publish the articles because she changed the direction of the Journal radically. The writings became part of several chapters of a book.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 17 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 30  Cruise down the Amazon River, with Mari, from Manaus, Brazil \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Anavilhanas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Boca de Valeria \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Santarem \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Devil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Island, French Guyana, St. George\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Grenada \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Magarita Island, Venezuela \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bridgetown, Barbados. But Oops! Mari and Rein missed the chartered plane from Miami and had to scramble to fly to New York \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sao Paulo \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Manaus to catch the cruise boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the City of Manaus (population 2 million) began in an Indian village built around the S\\xc3\\xa3o Jos\\xc3\\xa9 da Barra Fortress, in 1669. The fortress had been constructed to protect against the Dutch invaders garrisoned in Suriname (former Dutch Guyana) and to guarantee dominion of the Portuguese Crown in the region. In 1848, the small town of Vila da Barra was raised to the status of City, with the name Cidade da Barra do Rio Negro, and it finally received the name Man\\xc3\\xa1os, in 1856, to celebrate the Man\\xc3\\xa1o (Mother of the gods) Indian nation, the most important ethnic group in the region, acknowledged for their courage and bravery. \\xc2\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1890 and 1910, thanks to the exportation of natural rubber, the local businessmen and rulers brought in from the Europe hundreds of architects and landscape specialists, for the execution of an ambitious urban plan that would result in a city with European architectural profile, though embedded in the middle of a jungle. Modern and innovative, Manaus was one of the first Brazilian cities to have electricity, fluvial drainage system, water treatment, sewer system and electric streetcar service. Over a hundred years ago Manaus inaugurated the Amazonas Opera House which astonished the world for its luxury, refinement and beauty. In 1909 the first Brazilian University was founded - the Universidade Livre de Manaus (Autonomous University of Man\\xc3\\xa1os). The floating harbor, built to adapt to the tidal water level of the rivers, was totally imported from England. Several other public buildings were also imported from England. With the establishment of the Free Zone, in 1967, Manaus took advantage of the fiscal incentives to become the largest commercial and industrial sector near the Equator. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor those expecting to see only a sea of green of the Amazon rainforest when they fly into Manaus, the sight of a modern 2 million habitant city with high-rises and a busy port comes as a surprise. Manaus is 900 miles (1,450 km) inland from the Atlantic. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the heart of Amazonia (population 3.5 million) which is hot and humid. Rainfall is a given. Travelers to the area must expect the inconveniences that go with heat and moisture: insects, parasites, mud, less than hygienic conditions, possible claustrophobia from being surrounded by forest, stomach disorders and other ailments. To find out if you are a good candidate for an Amazon adventure, travelllers are encouraged to take a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShould I Go ToThe Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d quiz. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Amazon receives the most rainfall in Brazil, and the winter season is between June and August. The temperature was 35C with 70% humidity (on August 11, 2007).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazonia is responsible for 50% of the renovated oxygen on Earth, and its hydrographic basin contains over 1000 rivers and lakes, no less than one fifth of the fresh water reserves on Earth. The Amazon is one of Nature\\'s favourite shows, filled with the most exuberant flora and fauna known to man: thousands of noble century old trees, where nearly 15,000 species of animals live; among them 1,800 bird species, 2,000 kinds of mammals and 1,500 types of fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nManaus City sprawls, but the center of town, the Centro where most of the hotels and attractions are located, rises above the river on a slight hill. As the largest city and a major port on the river, Manaus is commercial. Local industries include brewing, shipbuilding, soap manufacturing, the production of chemicals, the manufacture of electronics equipment, and petroleum refining of oil brought to Manaus by boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheatro Amazonas is one of the most important monuments left by the exhilarating rubber boom period. It was preserved as a national partimony in 1965, and celebrated its centenary in 1996, in perfect condition after a thorough renovation that left it in its original colors and details. The architecture is eclectic and neo-classic with material and artists brought in from Europe. On the outside of the building, the dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag. In the shape of a harp, the central nave can seat 640 in the auditorium and there are 3 floors with box seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Manaus we sailed east down the river and stopped at two villages, Anavilhanas  and Boca de Valeria, where children had learned to beg from the tourists, by holding your hand and walking around the village with you. The villages had electrical generators, a school served by a government funded teacher, resident nurse and access to doctors by request. A priest made the rounds and buried the dead. A landing strip for small airplanes at each of the villages was located on top of the embankment. The people along the river seemed to be living well. We did not see much of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjungle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or flora and fauna, nor did we learn anything about the lives of villages some distance from the river.

The ceremony was based on old Estonian Viking traditions and was held at the Amstruther Lake cottage of Janis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Hamacher family.\\r\\n                                            \\r\\nTHE WEDDING CEREMONY AT THE HAMACHER HIIS:\\r\\nThe Vedic or Hindu scriptures teach that above else, the holiest shrine, the greatest temple, the most sacred place on earth, lies wholly within the innermost being of each of us all. One of the biggest problems with Christianity is that it really does not teach people how to relate and forge a relationship with the deity residing within them, within the very temple of their Self. We are all familiar with the sage advice, that it is good to know thyself. What is somewhat unclear is how to achieve it?\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Estonians worshipped the sun, but they also focused on the development of the self. The Buddha and Jesus at their transfiguration (the final deification of the soul or Nirvana) are reported as becoming fully into beings of light \\xe2\\x80\\x93 shining like the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancient Estonians were also animists, who believed that everything in nature had a spirit, related to themselves, and therefore nature had to be respected. The responsibility for the protection of the environment was inherited, from the oral wisdom of ancestors, and passed down from generation to generation. Modern Savants, have started to discover the importance of the environment only relatively recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Estonians lived in small groups of extended families. Located outside the boundaries of their villages, in fields or woods, were special sacred groves that were carefully maintained. Here they gathered for ceremonies, counsel, to resolve disputes, to worship Taara --- including the celebration of weddings. When Michael showed me a rock outcrop, and how it was such a special place, I immediately associated it with being the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHamacher Hiis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. These can be special places where each family can maintain a quiet place for reflection and celebration of being a community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hiis was a place where nature was left in its undisturbed state, hay was not mown, animals were not pastured, berries were not gathered and in particular there was a taboo against chopping down trees, who were believed to be ancestors who had been transformed into trees. No weapons were allowed within the confines of the Hiis. This was a place of peace and love.\\r\\n\\r\\nA basic rule of nature, of the Taara religion, was that everything in nature was inter-connected. If you disturb or harm one part of nature, then other parts will suffer also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taara religion taught that our faith should be a positive expression of our inner life. Godliness was within us and we must develop our innermost self in concert with our stewardship of nature, our understanding of God would be gradual and dependent on our increasing understanding of the miracle of nature. But Taara, as God, and the complete mystery of nature, were ultimately beyond human comprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been surprised to learn that most sustained religions seek very similar goals: charity (transcendance from greed, egotism, hatred, and violence) and compassion (the Golden Rule) in our relationships with each other. They often follow different rituals to affirm how one must approach the sacred. But many of the fundamental basics seem to be the same in most contexts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancient Estonians\\' concept of the world was based, above all, on the image of a circle. People were a part of two basic circles: the circle of life and the annual circle of seasons. There was only one big circle of life, whereas the annual circle repeated itself over and over.There were four significant events in the cycle of life: birth, coming-of-age, marriage, and death. The annual cycle, based on the movement of the sun was divided in two, by the winter and summer solstices. These two turning points are still the most important holidays celebrated since ancient times. \\r\\nAncient Estonians celebrated Midsummer (JUNE 24 -- Jaanip\\xc3\\xa4ev) with bonfires. It was a night of fire festivals and of love. Pairs of lovers would jump through luck-bringing bonfire flames. It was believed that the crops would grow as high as the couples were able to jump. And through the fire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power, unmarried maidens would find out the truth about their future husbands, and by jumping over the fire, spirits and demons would be banished from harming the family.\\r\\nFire also symbolized the power of the sun. Therefore, another function of bonfires was to generate sympathetic magic: giving a boost to the benevolant sun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s energy so that it would remain potent throughout the rest of the growing season and guarantee a plentiful harvest.\\r\\nRein was able to find an old lament or prayer to the sun that had been transmitted from generation to generation verbally \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\r\\nA LAMENT:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOH, RISE AGAIN, OH SUN !\\r\\nDON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T LEAVE US HERE\\r\\nWE ARE ONLY A FEW\\r\\nOUR JOURNEYS ARE LONG\\r\\nRISE, OH SUN, AT THE START OF EACH DAY !\\r\\nWE WILL SHARE OUR HARVEST WITH YOU\\r\\nDO NOT FORSAKE US\\r\\nCOME TO US AGAIN AND AGAIN !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis historical background brings us to our wedding ceremony today (June 23, 2006), at the Hamacher Hiis. It is very appropriate that Jeff is playing his Cello on the outcrop. Ancient Estonians often played a bagpipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I would like to explain some ancient symbolism, associated with a Taara marriage ceremony:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.The bride and groom are asked to jump ceremonially over a bonfire.\\r\\n2. It is customary then for the bride and groom to tie strips of cloth to the branches of a tree where a stork had supposedly made its nest.\\r\\n3. This would act as a memory forever of the start of the lives of the two lovers together. \\r\\n4. The hands of the bride and groom would then be tied together with cloth to symbolize their wedding. \\r\\n5. The bridegroom would make an offering to Taara to keep the devil at bay with his lightening bolts, by throwing silver coins into the water (often a well if no other body of water was nearby). \\r\\n6. The newlyweds would be given a loaf of good Estonian bread (so that they never would go hungry), salt (to preserve and flavour their food) and some money to seed their prosperity together. \\r\\n7. The bride, groom, maid of honour and best man would receive traditional Estonian broaches to act as witness to this sacred occasion at the Hamacher Hiis, to be remembered for ever and ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing prayer (by Rein):\\r\\nWe have conducted this ancient ceremony to join these 2 young people together, forever, as man and wife. We, who are gathered here, will support and protect you as sister and brother. May Tara help us!\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing Prayer (by Mari):\\r\\nWe gather together at this Hiis rock, as two of you unite in a very special ceremony. We pray that you two will share a bond of friendship, truth and love, which God willing will endure for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nA SHORT ODE TO JANIS AND MICHAEL (by Mari)\\r\\n\\r\\nHold hands, hold hands with God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bounteous Grace,\\r\\nBow your heads for Nobler Future Deeds.\\r\\nLook, look, at each other face to face,\\r\\nAnd know that you can sow future seeds!\\r\\nTake care to join in a circle around you,\\r\\nThat brings love and trust and fair play.\\r\\nToday is just the beginning of a journey,\\r\\nOf a lifetime that is yet far, far away!\\r\\n\\r\\nMay an Angel always guard you,\\r\\nMay love always be in your hearts.\\r\\nI know Grandma and Grandpa are with us,\\r\\nHere, in spirit, where Taara minds us all.\\r\\nDear Janis and Michael,\\r\\nI wish you ten \\xe2\\x80\\x98Thou shalts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for your consideration:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Thou shalt endlessly be generous with your time for each other, because moments lost cannot be recouped.\\r\\n2. Thou shalt be loving and forgiving, because mistakes will happen.\\r\\n3. Thou shalt be adventurous, because we all need change to feel alive.\\r\\n4. Thou shalt be comfortable, because comfort makes a home.\\r\\n5.  Thou shalt have animals, for they give back unconditional love.\\r\\n6.  Thou shalt plant a garden to see and taste the fruits of your labour.\\r\\n7.  Thou shalt be somewhat frugal and waste not, want not.\\r\\n8.  Thou shalt take time, to do nothing, to enjoy each other, to   replenish the soul.  \\r\\n9.  Thou shalt endeavour to learn all aspects of living and giving.\\r\\n10 Thou shalt bring each other flowers remembering fragility as the   beauty of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the record, Michael, always remember \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Jenny used to call you, in frustration: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichael, Michael, Daniel, Peter!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and with love: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJaberwocky\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmotormouth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYackety-Yack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Grandma added \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMihkel Kurat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But, most importantly, you dear Michael, said to me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are home and love is now here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael could talk endlessly and he has always had a love for music. Nurtured first by the choir at Humber Valley School, and then came a Guitar, then a drum set, then something called a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWah-wah\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and then and then, and then, away you flew!\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael has a Maritime soul, for sailboats and Brigantines. He has a gentle soul, and a caring heart \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 which I know is now dedicated to Janis.\\r\\n\\r\\nJanis or in Estonian J\\xc3\\x84NES, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy little rabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you as well, but believe you are a caring, sharing, joyous, and positive person, with great many talents. You have such a fantastic smile, Janis \\xe2\\x80\\xa6  WE LOVE YOU, DEARLY!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that Grandma and Grandpa are here in spirit and they agree.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Cape Breton we learned an old Scottish toast \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLong may yer lum reak!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Literally meaning \\'long\\xc2\\xa0may your chimney smoke\\', this was the best way to wish someone a\\xc2\\xa0long\\xc2\\xa0and healthy life.) A Cape Breton toast to you two \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to add my own: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLove you to pieces, Long May Your Jam Jell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t ---------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 30 Rein delivered sermon at Humber Valley Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 26 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 29 Leif and Mari-Ann from Stockholm visited Toronto and stayed at 2 Aberfoyle.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 27 Working with Neil on his dissertation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 1- 2 RCGP participants arrived and Rein was involved in their Orientation.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 8 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 9 Mari in Poor Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Summer Camp helping Jennifer.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 11 Working with Gideon on his research paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 13 Rein worked with Neil on his dissertation at Timothy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.

At Cape Dorset we spread the ashes of a famous Arctic explorer/entrepreneur who had helped improve the marketability of Inuit carvings, paintings and weaving that nowadays sells all over the world. His son and successor , John James Houston, was our host and has carried on his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in the Great White North is a world away from the rest of the country. In fact, anyone from below the Canadian Territories is called a \"southerner.\" As of the\\xc2\\xa02011 census,\\xc2\\xa0the population of the capital city of Nunavut, Iqaluit, was hovering around 7,000, by far the largest community. The territory had a population just over 31,000. Nunavut\\xc2\\xa0became Canada\\'s third territory on April 1,1999. Nunavut\\'s 25\\xc2\\xa0municipalities\\xc2\\xa0cover only\\xc2\\xa00.2% of the territory\\'s land mass\\xc2\\xa0but are home to\\xc2\\xa099.97% of its population.  It is the largest territory and has one-fifth of the land area of Canada. Nunavut\\xc2\\xa0is made up of a mainland and many islands in the Arctic Ocean. Baffin Island and Ellesmere Island are two of the largest islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIqaluit is home to a legislative assembly with 19 seats. Decisions are made by consensus and are not done along party lines. Iqaluit has been a traditional fishing place used by the Inuit for thousands of years, hence the name Iqaluit, which means\\xc2\\xa0place of many fish. In 1942 an American air base was built there, intended to provide a stop-over and refuelling site for short range aircraft being ferried across the Atlantic to support the war effort in Europe. American Air Force planners chose a site with a large flat area suitable for a landing strip. The air field gave a major boost to local habitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Hudson\\'s Bay Company\\xc2\\xa0moved its south Baffin operations to the neighbouring valley of Niaqunngut in 1949 to take advantage of the airfield. The population increased rapidly during the construction of the\\xc2\\xa0Distant Early Warning Line\\xc2\\xa0(DEW line), a system of radar stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can imagine, getting groceries shipped up north can be inconvient. There are grocery stores in each community, but prices are\\xc2\\xa0exceedingly high. A two litre carton of milk can ring in at $12.49, with most other items being about double the cost than we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re used to in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSouth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Household water is capped off at 22.5 litres per person per day in communities with piped service. In Iqaluit, trucks roam the streets each day, stopping at houses to fill up their water tanks.\\xc2\\xa0There are three Tim Horton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kiosks in Iqaluit. Nunavut was the last territory in Canada to get a\\xc2\\xa0Tim Hirton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Although traditional Inuit drum dancing and throat singing is still done, these days kids are more enamoured with hip hop and breakdance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 21 Meeting with Valliere at Orwell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pub about our two joint articles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 30 Mari and Rein attended information session of Sleeping Children Around the World Charity. They volunteered to go to Bangladesh to deliver and hand out bedkits and school materials for poor children.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 19 Trip to Moscow with Mari for the RCGP Final Annual Meetings. Mari received a tour-guided view of Moscow and we met at the religious complex outside the city. Rein delivered lecture at the Russian Finance Academy. On the way back we visited Dresden and N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg to retrace some of Rein and Romulus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 escape route from Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Neumarkt in Dresden\\xc2\\xa0has been for centuries a central and culturally significant section of the\\xc2\\xa0Dresden\\xc2\\xa0inner city. The historic area was almost completely wiped out during the\\xc2\\xa0unnecessary Allied bombing attacks\\xc2\\xa0during the\\xc2\\xa0Second World War. After the war Dresden fell under\\xc2\\xa0Soviet occupation\\xc2\\xa0and later the\\xc2\\xa0communist\\xc2\\xa0German Democratic Republic\\xc2\\xa0who rebuilt the Neumarkt area in\\xc2\\xa0socialist realist\\xc2\\xa0style of some historic buildings.\\r\\nThe completion of the reconstructed\\xc2\\xa0Dresden Frauenkirche\\xc2\\xa0in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the original Neumarkt. Organisations such as the Gesellschaft Historischer Neumarkt Dresden actively encouraged a historically-faithful reconstruction of the structures around the Neumarkt, giving an outward appearance as close as possible to that from before 1945. The areas around the square have been divided into 8 \"Quarters\", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings will be rebuilt either to the style of the original structure or at least with a facade similar to the original. The Frauenkirche really reflects its ancient original fa\\xc3\\xa7ade. Bricks from the World War II, that destroyed the church have been imbedded, cleverly, to remind people of the crime that was committed.\\r\\nThere has also been extensive debate as to what extent some contemporary architecture should be present on the rebuilt Neumarkt. The reconstruction of the structures surrounding the Neumarkt has been examined by architecture critic Andreas Ruby, criticising the attempt to reconstruct the historic character of the city as inauthentic, likening it to the recreation of Venice to be found around the\\xc2\\xa0Venetian Resort Hotel\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0Las Vegas. \\r\\nThe Nazis saw N\\xc3\\xbcrnberg as a classic example of a city rich in Germanic Imperial history. Indeed, Hitler agreed that it was the \"most Germanic of German cities.\" He ordered the creation of huge week-long gatherings,that brought hundreds of thousands of people to the city to view Nazi phony ersatz nationalistic and militaristic extravaganzas. \\r\\nTo better accommodate these massive rallies, Hitler turned to his favorite architect Albert Speer (designer of the New Reichs Chancellery in Berlin, and later the Nazi Minister of Armaments) to design and build a suitable site, which would become the\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cheroic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nazi Party Rallying Grounds.\\r\\nN\\xc3\\xbcrnberg was conquered by the U.S. Army on 17-20 April 1945. The city suffered many Allied bombing raids. Despite intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent, restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of some of its medieval buildings.\\xc2\\xa0However, over half of the historic look of the center of the city,\\xc2\\xa0was lost forever.\\r\\nToday examples of\\xc2\\xa0Nazi architecture\\xc2\\xa0can barely be seen in the city. The pretentious architecture of AlbertSpeer at the Nazi parade gathering grounds was badly damaged during wartime bombing attacks, and most of his ruins were dynamited after the war. A portion of the old steps leading to Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s podium remain today.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0The U.S. Army blew up the large swastika on the top of the backdrop to the speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s podium in 1945. \\r\\nBecause the structures were built hastily, of somewhat shoddy materials, they are deteriorating today. Wire guards protect visitors from pieces of masonry that can come loose from the upper fa\\xc3\\xa7ades. The entire rear wall has been fenced off. Paving stones, at the spot where Hitler stood, have been removed by souvenir hunters. The columns on either side of the grandstand were removed in 1967 because they were thought to be deteriorating and were considered dangerous.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nAfter the war the U.S. Army turned the Nazi Arena into a vehicle motor park. Today the grassy areas are considered an excellent sun bathing venue. Very little is left of Hitler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nazi attempt to add to Germanic Imperial history of the city, through ersatz nationalistic militaristic extravaganzas. It seems that architecture critic Andreas Ruby is right, in criticising attempts to completely reconstruct the historic character of a city, it is indeed inauthentic.\\r\\nOct.23 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCorporate Governance in Dominant Shareholder Firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d paper was sent to Chris Mullen, Editor in Chief, Corporate Governance: The International\\xc2\\xa0Journal\\xc2\\xa0of Business in the UK. Rein had interviewed Bill Dimma the man who has sat on more boards of Directors than anyone else in Canada. He had other data and we combined the two. Unfortunately Chris Mullen was replaced as Editor and the Journal was reorganized and moved to The USA. Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99 paper was rejected and he never finished it and it sits in a file.\\r\\nOct. 24 Another meeting with Valliere, at Orwells Pub, on a joint research paper.\\r\\nNov. 2 Rein: Pacemaker checkup at TGH.\\r\\nNov. 15 Ultrasound with Dr. Dymon.\\r\\nNov. 16 Rein Chaired, as President, a Board Meeting of the No.1398 Condo Corporation in which he lived.\\r\\nNov. 17 RCGP Report Draft sent to Moscow to Higer School of Economics, our RCGP partner, for agreement and signatures.\\r\\nRein continued working with MBA student groups, of about 8 persons, on their Corporate Strategy Analysis Reports during this period. He was supervising 8 groups of 8 at a time, for 8 months each.\\r\\nNov. 23, 29 Meetings with Neil on his PhD dissertation at Ryerson.\\r\\nDec. 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 13 Rein and Valliere flew to Secunderabad/Hyderabad to present an academic paper at the Indian Business School that had organized an International Management Conference. The World Consulting & Research Corporation had ranked IBS Hyderabad, among Asia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Best Private Educational Institutions as selected by KPMG. It turned out to be a good academic conference.\\r\\nAlthough\\xc2\\xa0Hyderabad\\xc2\\xa0and Secunderabad are together referred to as the twin cities, they have both different histories and cultures. Secunderabad having developed directly under\\xc2\\xa0British\\xc2\\xa0rule until 1948, while Hyderabad was at the  same time the capital of the\\xc2\\xa0Nizams\\' princely state across the boundary Lake.\\r\\nWe stayed at the famous Secunderabad Club which\\xc2\\xa0was established in 1878 at a country house gifted by\\xc2\\xa0Salar Jung I. Secunderabad had a more laid-back atmosphere due to the fact that it was mainly a residential area with fewer government offices and corporate establishments. Some of the trees growing on the Club campus, were over 100 years old and still proudly played host to a variety of chirping birds, making the club an oasis of calm in the middle of the terrible hustle-bustle of a busy Indian city.\\r\\nUp until 1947 only British Citizens were allowed to be President of the Club, and only a handful of high ranking Hyderabad nobility were offered membership in The Secunderabad Club. The earliest records state that this Club was formed by British\\xc2\\xa0Garrisons\\xc2\\xa0that were stationed in Secunderabad under an agreement with the 5th Nizam \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSikander Jah\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Club was then known as Garrison Club.\\r\\nWinston Churchill, the Prime Minister of England during World War II, was posted in Secunderabad during the 1880s as a subaltern. While he lived in a bungalow, he was a member of the Club. He was very conscious of the fact that he and his colleagues were in Secunderabad to keep guard on the Nizam and the Old City of Hyderabad, across the Lake. They were convinced that it contained \"all the scoundrels of Asia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Legend has it that Churchill\\'s unit was suddenly transferred, at such short notice, that he was unable to settle his outstanding bill with the Secunderabad Club. This document has become a part of the Club\\'s archives.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Valliere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife is from Secunderabad and we were treated to a taste of the big city by her relatives. They showed us the many sights that they thought were important. Rein bought a string of pearls for Mari, from an expensive store that the relatives had relationships with. It was a successful trip. What little Rein knows about India was mostly garnered on this trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the year Rein started to serve as a Volunteer Financial Advisor for a Humber Valley United Church committee, helping a refugee family from Chechnya settle in Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 23 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 27 Mari and Rein visited Luka, Jacob, Janis and Mike in Ottawa by car, for Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDec. 31 Mari and Rein had dinner at French Bistro \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Biffs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and attended the TOT production of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCandide\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n2007  \\r\\nJapan launched its fourth spy satellite, stepping up its ability to monitor potential threats such as North Korea.\\r\\nEstonian parliamentary election: approximately 30,000 voters take advantage of electronic voting in Estonia, world\\'s 1st nationwide vote where part of the vote casting was allowed by remote electronic voting.          \\r\\nThe Scottish National Party won the Scottish general election and became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament for the first time ever.\\r\\nEstonian authorities moved the statue of a Bronze Soldier, a Soviet Red Army war memorial in central Tallinn, amid political controversy with Russia.

We were all very apprehensive about going on shore in Algeries.We received a military escort from 16 soldiers with M-16s and three police cars that escorted us with their sirens blaring through Algeries to a small village in the mountains. We met some of the local colourful native people, who were very glad to see tourists (finally?).\\r\\n\\r\\nRein later decided to explore why so many of the Algerians were terrorists.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAQIM, was an\\xc2\\xa0Islamist\\xc2\\xa0militant organization which aimed to overthrow the\\xc2\\xa0Algerian\\xc2\\xa0government and institute an\\xc2\\xa0Islamic state. To that end, it was engaged in\\xc2\\xa0an anti-government campaign. AQIM had voiced support for\\xc2\\xa0demonstrations against the Tunisian\\xc2\\xa0and Algerian Governments. Al Qaeda offered military aid and training to the demonstrators, calling on them to overthrow \"the corrupt, criminal and tyrannical\" regime, calling for \"retaliation\" against the Tunisian government, and also calling for the overthrow of the Algerian president.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter independence, Algeria had adopted a single-party system and prevented the younger generation from having access to or influence political developments. Instead of ruling through the political FLN, the President focused his attention on the military elite and enforced a ban on political parties and organisations initiated after independence. Conditions deteriorated further and led to the formation of Islamic fundamentalist and extremist groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nFront de Lib\\xc3\\xa9ration Nationale, FLN, was a\\xc2\\xa0socialist-political party\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0Algeria. It was the principal nationalist movement during the\\xc2\\xa0Algerian War\\xc2\\xa0and the sole legal and the ruling political party of the Algerian state until other parties were legalised in 1989. Recognising the harm done in the process of the Government rewriting official history, a newspaper on 24 November 1988 wrote, we must recover our memory, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call our memory, without filters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe army had played a leading role in government since independence. It was moved \\xe2\\x80\\x98to the centre of authority` and reinstated \\xe2\\x80\\x98as the guarantor of the continuity of the regime and the protector of stability and public order.` This development eventually opened the door for the military establishment to intervene after the first round of elections. Prior to the elections, faced with the bread riots, a state of emergency had been declared that included harsh crackdowns. In fear of further political uprisings, the military turned Algeria into a police state, threatening freedom of speech by limiting the development of a political culture and an environment that allowed questioning and dissent. After the bread riots of October 1988, the President introduced a new multiparty constitution \\xe2\\x80\\x98to open up the political system and prevent further unrest.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 All this probably was a consequence of Algerian colonist history.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than a century France had maintained\\xc2\\xa0colonial rule\\xc2\\xa0in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including\\xc2\\xa0Sharia\\xc2\\xa0laws applied by Islamic customary courts. Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties.\\xc2\\xa0 \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a reform effort in 1947, the French created a\\xc2\\xa0bicameral legislature\\xc2\\xa0with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims; but gave a European\\'s vote equal seven times more weight than a Muslim\\'s vote. Paramilitary groups such as the\\xc2\\xa0National Liberation Front\\xc2\\xa0appeared, claiming an Arab-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the\\xc2\\xa0Algerian War, in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term\\xc2\\xa0\"pied-noir\"\\xc2\\xa0began to be commonly used shortly before the end of the\\xc2\\xa0Algerian War\\xc2\\xa0in 1962. Pied-Noir, literally meaning \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlack-Foot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, was originally a term coined to refer to any white settler born in\\xc2\\xa0Africa, later evolving into a slang name for\\xc2\\xa0French\\xc2\\xa0settlers in\\xc2\\xa0Algeria. After the Algerian War of Independence in 1962, which led to Algeria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s independence from France, more than a million French Pied-Noir settlers returned to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven such colonial history, the existence of Muslim terrorism in Algeria (and perhaps in other African countries) shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be seen as a surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 10 Jakob Alexander was born in Ottawa, 7 Lbs. 12 0zs.

This activity was to take up 40% of Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time. It turned out that Management at Ryerson Universitywanted to launch new projects and then turn them over to Ted Rogers School of Management. Rein at the age of 69+ was the oldest person ever hired by Ryerson and the Human Resources Department had to seek special advice on what taxes, etc. should apply to such a contract.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first project was to be the launching of an Innovation Centre at Ryerson where student ventures from all university faculties could be launched. Interest was expressed in a support of Entrepreneur students Ryerson investment fund, and the support of mentors who would help in the launch of the new ventures and increase the probability of their success.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein had already been trying to help launch a new degree programme called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommercialisation of Innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jointly between the Engineering Faculty and Business School, during 2006. In the summer 2007 it was unclear if this could be a graduate or undergraduate degree or perhaps there would be both.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso Rein was to be responsible for launching an Entrepreneurial Economic Development Programme, funded by the Ontario government, for encouraging potentially high growth businesses, especially in Northern Ontario and away from the major cities. In 2006, Neil and Rein had written a funding proposal to the Ontario Government on behalf of the Ted Rogers Business School, and received $1 million of funding for two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein continued to help Ted Rogers faculty members to publish academic articles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were praying that Ontang passed his English examinations so he can get into Humber College (Ontang was studying and practicing music from 0500 to late at night, with some breaks, to pass the entrance examinations). He was not working currently -- laid off from construction during winter until March. He was also waiting to get his Passport back from the Canadian Border Service (because he had entered the country illegally and as a refugee). The Member of Parliament and Federal Opposition Leader, Michael Ignatieff, from our Etobicoke Lakeshore Area, helped us deal with the bureaucracy. Then Ontang needed to get his Passport renewed by Indonesia -- we were promised quick help by the Toronto Consul. Finally we hoped to get his Canadian Landed Immigrant Status papers by September. We were scheduled to go to Batak/Lake Toba in Indonesia to meet his mother (who was ill) and his large family (\"tribe\") who all wanted to see the new bride and maybe her parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 17 Meeting with Ken Jones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 18 - 22 Rein travelled to Belfast to visit a University based Innovation Centre that was considered to be one of the best in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSept. 28 Meeting with Ken Jones.\\r\\n\\r\\nOct. 15 Meeting with Dr. Tracktenberg. \\r\\n\\r\\n* March 8 \\r\\nMeeting with persons from Ontario Ministry of Universities and Colleges at Ryerson to discuss proposal for funding prepared by Rein (with the support of Neil Wolff and Ken Jones) on Ryerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behalf. The Minister liked the proposal to develop the local capability in Ontario cities for helping local businesses to grow. By the end of the month the Minister approved $1 million grant and challenged Rotman School of Business, Ivey School of Business, Schulich Business School and Queens School of Business to match similar proposals developed by Ted Rogers. Deszo Horvath invited Rein to prepare a Proposal for Schulich. Rein declined and informed him that he had signed an employment contract with Ted Rogers School of Management. Dezso was very upset about that and considered Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions as being an insult to Schulich and Rein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous employment of 37 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 29 Dr. Halls, Psychosocial\\xc2\\xa0Oncology Clinic,\\xc2\\xa0specialized team\\xc2\\xa0of social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists that provides \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 counselling and therapies to help you and your family cope with the diagnosis of cancer, reduce stress and improve your emotional well-being.

The city of Rhodes has an Old Town featuring the medieval Street of the Knights and the castlelike Palace of the Grand Masters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island Santorini was the site of one of the largest\\xc2\\xa0volcanic eruptions\\xc2\\xa0in recorded history. The eruption\\xc2\\xa0occurred some 3,600 years ago at the height of the\\xc2\\xa0Minoan civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by\\xc2\\xa0volcanic ash\\xc2\\xa0deposits hundreds of metres deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of\\xc2\\xa0Crete, 110\\xc2\\xa0km (68\\xc2\\xa0mi) to the south, through a gigantic\\xc2\\xa0tsunami. A popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of\\xc2\\xa0Atlantis.

She will be doing part time supply teaching this semester to support Ontang who is itching to start his music courses at Humber College, full time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were praying that Ontang passed his English examinations (we were to find out in January), gets into Humber College.

It\\'s also known for its French colonial landmarks, including Notre-Dame Cathedral, made entirely of materials imported from France, and the 19th-century Central Post Office. Food stalls line the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s streets, especially around bustling B\\xe1\\xba\\xbfn Th\\xc3\\xa0nh Market. There were a lot of American tourists visiting the remnant memories of the US defeat. There was an undertone of dislike among the local Vietnamese for what had happened to them after the Americans escaped by helicopter from the roof of the US Embassy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was incredible to know how the Viet Cong lived in the nearby Cu chi tunnels to avoid the American army during the war. This is an important piece of the history that many people don\\'t know about. It was possible for Rein to experience moving inside the tunnels. The guided tour was incredible because you were able to see the other side of Vietnam War history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hong Kong we met with our Chinese Daughters #1 and #2. They came to York University to learn how to teach English and spent 6 weeks living in our house. They did indeed become our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdaughters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during their stay and we loved them both. We have continued to maintain contact with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring\\xc2\\xa0World War II, the American\\xc2\\xa0atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\\xc2\\xa0made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a\\xc2\\xa0nuclear attack. The United States dropped\\xc2\\xa0nuclear weapons\\xc2\\xa0on the Japanese cities on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of\\xc2\\xa0World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the\\xc2\\xa0Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. This is reported by manyhistorians as the reason that the War with Japan was ended. Japan announced\\xc2\\xa0its surrender\\xc2\\xa0to the Allies on August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki.\\r\\n\\r\\nRein and Mari toured the Peace Park. Established in 1955, and near to the\\xc2\\xa0hypocenter\\xc2\\xa0of the explosion, remnants of a concrete wall of\\xc2\\xa0Urakami Cathedral\\xc2\\xa0can still be seen. Urakami Cathedral was the grandest church in east Asia at the time. At the park\\'s north end is the 10-meter-tall Peace Statue created by sculptor\\xc2\\xa0Seibo Kitamura\\xc2\\xa0of\\xc2\\xa0Nagasaki Prefecture. The statue\\'s right hand points to the threat of nuclear weapons while the extended left hand symbolizes eternal peace. The mild face symbolizes\\xc2\\xa0divine grace\\xc2\\xa0and the gently closed eyes offer a prayer for the repose of the bomb victims\\' souls. The folded right leg and extended left leg signify both meditation and the initiative to stand up and rescue the people of the world. It was a very emotional day for Mari and Rein.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 26 Meeting of Ryerson University Business Incubation Centre (RUBIC). RUBIC had been vigorously adopted by the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office and became a university wide programme called DMZ. Rein was not included in its further development, nor did he get any credit for it. But DMZ (alias RUBIC) was launched successfully. Apparently President Sheldon Levy had decided to make a greater reputation for himself and used his extensive resources to launch DMZ.  According to Ryerson University publicity:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe DMZ at Ryerson University is one of Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest business incubators for emerging tech startups.The\\xc2\\xa0top-ranked university incubator in North America and third in the world, it helps startups succeed by connecting them with customers, advisors, influencers and other entrepreneurs. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a space and community that encourages, supports and fosters new technologies that transform lives and businesses.\\r\\nThe DMZ is based at Ryerson, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just for students; this unique community is home to entrepreneurs and innovators of all ages from across Toronto, Canada and the world. Overlooking the heart of downtown Toronto at Yonge-Dundas Square, the DMZ is a hub of innovation and collaboration.\\r\\nThe DMZ opened its doors in April 2010. Then Ryerson University president Sheldon Levy saw the value in creating a space on campus that would encourage students, alumni and young entrepreneurs from the wider community to collaborate, innovate and create. The goal was to forge a home for digital industry and entrepreneurship in Toronto, and keep talent in Canada.\\r\\nSix years after launching, 260 startups have incubated at the DMZ. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve raised $206 million in seed funding and have fostered the creation of more than 2,407 jobs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve acquired customers, won awards, grown their teams and developed products and solutions that are positively changing lives and businesses in Canada and abroad.\\r\\nEntrepreneurship isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a trend; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s key to the future of economic prosperity in Canada. The DMZ is helping strengthen that future by fuelling the success of emerging entrepreneurial leaders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nMarch 29 Mari and Rein attended the MBA Formal Dance at Schulich.\\r\\nApril 4 Knud Jensen and Rein meet at Bayview Village to prepare the Rough Outline for the workshops that will be called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrowing Ontario Firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (GOF), funded by a $1million dollar grant from the Ontario Government. The million dollar grant was obviously granted to clear the budget of the agency at the end of the year budget process.\\r\\nApril 14 - 18 Rein attended a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCoaching workshop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to pick up skills and ideas for GOF.\\r\\nApril 21 Rein and Neil meet with Vice-President Adam to update and coach him on our ideas on RUBIC. No feedback was given to us.\\r\\nApril 22 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 29 Mari and Rein travelled to Las Vegas on the RCI points they had earned as owners of the Condo in Orlando, Florida.\\r\\nThe city bills itself as\\xc2\\xa0The Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its mega casino\\xe2\\x80\\x93hotels and associated entertainment. The city\\'s tolerance for numerous forms of adult entertainment earned it the title of\\xc2\\xa0Sin City, and has made Las Vegas a popular setting for films, television programs, and music videos. With the Strip expansion in the 1990s, downtown Las Vegas - which had tried to maintain \\xe2\\x80\\x9can old Las Vegas feel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d began to suffer. However, in recent years the city has made strides in turning around the fortunes of this urban area. The Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area, and has been popular since its startup in 1995.\\r\\nMari and Rein found the downtown an unreal blaze of artificial glaring lighting, a capitalist paradise that worked on human weaknesses, particularily sex and gambling. We did see two excellent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCirque de Soleil\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shows. (The startup company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial financial hardships were relieved in 1983 by a government grant from the\\xc2\\xa0Canada Council for the Arts.) We, like everyone else in Vegas, were trying to escape everyday life routines and reality.\\r\\nMay 5 Rein went to see Dr. Trackdenberg.\\r\\nMay 15 Growing Ontario Firms (GOF) Workbook completed.\\r\\nJune 2 Ken Jones hired Alan Carsrud as first Loretta Rogers Research Chair  in Entrepreneurship.

I, of course knew, but didn\\'t fully appreciate how the CHEMO kicks the the shit out of you --- it kills both cancer cells and all the good cells it comes in contact with. Thursday we will have our next C-T Scan to see whether we have retarded the progress of the cancer or not. In any case I am going to argue that we not do any more such CHEMOs and weaken Mari any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKallid Anne ja Jaan ...\\r\\nSee mis j\\xc3\\xa4rgneb olen saatnud oma sugulastele ja s\\xc3\\xb5pradelle.\\r\\nMari is doing well under the circumstances. She is a very brave woman\\r\\nand her mood is upbeat (I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let her be otherwise). Some days she gets\\r\\nnauseous or light-headed, in the morning, or when she gets overly tired. She doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much stamina. I am doing all the shopping and cooking. We have a housekeeper who comes and cleans the condo every 3 weeks. I have also the pleasure of giving her needles and supervising the taking of multiple pills. I have become a domesticated male nurse. What a comedown from \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctenured full professor emeritus; ex-dean emeritus; Viking emeritus, etc., etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 or on second thought, what a great honour!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey all said it was an unknown remedy. The first time she handled it well and I expect her to do the same on Monday. I am convinced that the Oncologists don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know very much about their remedies. One doctor admitted that their greatest recent realization has been that they are dealing with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccancerS, note the capital \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. That is their latest BIG(?)\\r\\nbreakthrough --- finally they have stumbled on recognizing that they\\r\\nwere treating a disease with multiple strains. This of course is of no great\\r\\nhelp to us. What the hell has all the money donated to them for all these\\r\\nyears been spent on? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey seem to have very few real tools to deal with Mari\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tumors. Each ad hoc concoction of Chemo is an intuitive guess. We seem to have tried them all.We are told that Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto is one of the\\r\\nbest cancer(s?) treatment centres in the world.

Over the last century, Dar es Salaam has transformed from a sleepy Zaramo fishing village into a smoke-belching metropolis of over four million people. Straddling some of the most important sea routes in the world, it is\\xc2\\xa0East Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second-busiest port and Tanzania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commercial and cultural hub. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Concept of\\xc2\\xa0Ujamaa\\xc2\\xa0formed the basis of\\xc2\\xa0the first President, Julius Nyerere\\'s social and economic development policies in\\xc2\\xa0Tanzania\\xc2\\xa0after\\xc2\\xa0Tanganyika\\xc2\\xa0gained independence from its colonial power\\xc2\\xa0Britain\\xc2\\xa0in 1961 and its union with\\xc2\\xa0Zanzibar\\xc2\\xa0to form\\xc2\\xa0Tanzania\\xc2\\xa0in 1964. The word Ujamaa comes from the Swahili word for extended family or familyhood or unity and is distinguished by several key characteristics, namely that a person becomes a person through the people or community.\\r\\n\\r\\nNyerere ordered his security forces to forcibly transfer much of the population to collective farms and, because of opposition from villagers, often burned villages down. This campaign pushed the nation to the brink of\\xc2\\xa0starvation\\xc2\\xa0and made it dependent on foreign food aid.\\r\\nIn 1985 Nyerere left Tanzania as one of the poorest, least developed, and most foreign aid-dependent countries in the world,\\xc2\\xa0although much progress in services such as health and education had nevertheless been achieved\\r\\nBefore independence, German East Africa was a\\xc2\\xa0German colony\\xc2\\xa0in the\\xc2\\xa0African Great Lakes\\xc2\\xa0region, which included what are now Burundi,\\xc2\\xa0Rwanda, and the mainland part of present\\xc2\\xa0Tanzania; this area was nearly three times the area of present-day Germany.\\r\\nThe colony was organized when the German military was called upon to put down a revolt against the activities of a\\xc2\\xa0colonial company\\xc2\\xa0during the late 1880s. It ended with\\xc2\\xa0Imperial Germany\\'s defeat in\\xc2\\xa0World War I. It was then divided between\\xc2\\xa0Britain\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Belgium\\xc2\\xa0and reorganized as a\\xc2\\xa0mandate of the League of Nations.\\r\\nThe city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s architecture, as a result, is a mix of African, Arab, Indian and German influences. A quaint little German colonial Lutheran Church is now dwarfed by towering high-rises which reflect Dar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rising prosperity.\\xc2\\xa0The church was built in 1898 by German missionaries and was the centre of the German Lutheran mission in Tanzania.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 20 we boarded the Rovos Rail Train and were assigned a comfortable private cabin. Rovos Rail\\xc2\\xa0was billed as luxury train travel throughout Africa. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Pride of Africa train was hailed as the most luxurious train in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Our 15-day train journey travelled through Tanzania, Zambia, (Malawi), Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Cape to Cairo Railway\\xc2\\xa0is an uncompleted project to cross Africa from south to north by\\xc2\\xa0rail and telegraph. This plan was initiated at the end of the 19th century, by Cecil Rhodes, to connect adjacent African possessions of the\\xc2\\xa0British Empire\\xc2\\xa0through a continuous line from\\xc2\\xa0Cape Town,\\xc2\\xa0South Africa\\xc2\\xa0to\\xc2\\xa0Cairo,\\xc2\\xa0Egypt. While most sections of the Cape to Cairo railway, are at least moderately, in operation (on which, we travelled) a major part of the original dream is still missing between northern\\xc2\\xa0Sudan\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Uganda. A large part of the Sudanese railway network is currently in disrepair due to political turmoil. Similar difficulties exist in Uganda. But the concept of a Cape to Cairo Railway is not dead. Tangible concepts have been forwarded to complete the link between Sudan and East Africa for economic reasons\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founder of Rovos Rail, Rohan Vos, had a passion for aging locomotives, that were going out of use. He began collecting old trains. At the end of 1986, Vos found a class 19D locomotive built by Borsig in 1938. Rohan Vos started the family-owned railway company Rovos Rail Touring Company in 1989. Our antique Rovos Rai train could house no more than 72 passangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 21 We first travelled through the large Selous Game Reserve and arrived in Makambo, A proposed new site for wind turbines was being built south west of Makambako town, close to the junction of the Tanzania \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Zambia Highway.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 22 Tunduma \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Nakonde lie between the United Republic of Tanzania (including Island of Zanzibar) and Zambia and handles traffic from Dar es Salaam to Lusaka, Zambia and DR Congo. We travelled from Dar es Salaam, to\\xc2\\xa0Kapiri Mposhi, near the\\xc2\\xa0Copperbelt\\xc2\\xa0of central\\xc2\\xa0Zambia, by the TAZARA Railway tracks, which is sometimes regarded as the greatest engineering effort of its kind since the Second World War. The railway was built by the Chinese to provide access to copper fields in Zambia. It was a very smooth ride on this part of the railway trip. This was not true on the remaining Zambia Railway tracks.\\r\\nWe passed by the Republic of Malawi on the East (left) side of the tracks. Malawi is among the world\\'s\\xc2\\xa0least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based on agriculture, with a largely rural population.\\r\\nMalawi is a\\xc2\\xa0landlocked country\\xc2\\xa0in southeast Africa that was formerly known as\\xc2\\xa0Nyasaland. It is bordered by\\xc2\\xa0Zambia\\xc2\\xa0to the northwest,\\xc2\\xa0Tanzania\\xc2\\xa0to the northeast, and\\xc2\\xa0Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by\\xc2\\xa0Lake Malawi. Malawi has an estimated population of 16,800,000. Its capital is\\xc2\\xa0Lilongwe (population 1,077,116). The country is nicknamed \"The Warm Heart of Africa\".\\r\\nMalawi is among the smallest countries in Africa. Lake Malawi takes about a third of Malawi\\'s area. Missionary and explorer\\xc2\\xa0David Livingstone\\xc2\\xa0reached Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) in 1859 and identified the\\xc2\\xa0Shire Highlands\\xc2\\xa0south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement\\r\\nJuly 24 After visits by\\xc2\\xa0European explorers\\xc2\\xa0in the eighteenth century, Zambia became the British protectorate of\\xc2\\xa0Northern Rhodesia\\xc2\\xa0towards the end of the nineteenth century. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the\\xc2\\xa0British South Africa Company. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Central African Federation\\xc2\\xa0(CAF), was a semi-independent\\xc2\\xa0federation\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nof three southern African\\xc2\\xa0territories \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia (Rhodesia) and the British protectorates of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Nyasaland (Malawi) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 between 1953 and 1963. Its white minority rule, where a couple of hundred thousand Europeans - primarily in Southern Rhodesia - ruled over millions of Africans. It was largely driven by paternalistic reformism, which included a mild form of racism that collided with rising African self-confidence and nationalism.\\r\\nIn 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister\\xc2\\xa0Kenneth Kaunda\\xc2\\xa0became the inaugural president. Kaunda\\'s socialist\\xc2\\xa0United National Independence Party\\xc2\\xa0(UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly independent country, Zambia (pop. 16,800,000) declared the city Lusaka (pop. 2,200,000) their capital city at independence in 1964. Lusaka lies approximately 100 kilometres from the border with Zimbabwe.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nTwo events symbolise a deep relationship with China: Zambian support for the restoration of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seat at the United Nations in 1971 and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s building and financing the TAZARA railway. Zambia helped the PRC agitate for its inclusion in the UN and voted in favour of it in the historic 1971 General Assembly vote. Chinese people still remember \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe soul-touching scene of African representatives celebrating China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory with singing and dancing at the United Nations which remains an unfading memory in Chinese people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe 1,860-kilometre TAZARA railway that links Tanzania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest city and port, Dar es Salaam, with Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Central Province was built from 1970 to 1975. The railway was entirely concessionally financed by China at a cost of roughly $500 million and trans-ships Zambian copper to world markets.\\r\\nThe Copperbelt Province\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0Zambia\\xc2\\xa0fuelled the economic hopes of the immediate post-independence period, but its economic importance was severely damaged by a crash in global\\xc2\\xa0copper\\xc2\\xa0prices in 1973. The Zambian province adjoins Katanga\\xc2\\xa0province of the\\xc2\\xa0Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is similarly copper mineral-rich.\\r\\nWhen for the first time since 1989 Zambia\\'s economic growth reached the 6%-7% mark (in 2007) they needed to reduce poverty significantly. Today, copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and the opening of new mines. The maize harvest was good in 2005, helping boost GDP and agricultural exports. Cooperation continues with international bodies on programs to reduce poverty, including a new lending arrangement with the IMF in the second quarter of 2004. A tighter monetary policy should help cut inflation, but Zambia still has a serious problem with high public debt.\\r\\nThe\\xc2\\xa0Zambezi\\xc2\\xa0is the\\xc2\\xa0fourth-longest\\xc2\\xa0river\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0Africa, it rises in\\xc2\\xa0Zambia\\xc2\\xa0and flows through eastern Angola, along the eastern border of\\xc2\\xa0Namibia\\xc2\\xa0and northern border of Botswana, then along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, where it crosses the country to empty into the Indian Ocean. There are two main sources of\\xc2\\xa0hydroelectric\\xc2\\xa0power on the river, which provide power to Zambia and Zimbabwe and power, downstream, to Mozambique and South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 23 and 24 We passed through Kafue National Park, Kundulila Falls, Kafu, Choma, and Lusaka.\\r\\nJuly 25 and 26 Livingstone is a town in Zimbabwe. It lies on the southern bank of the\\xc2\\xa0Zambezi River\\xc2\\xa0at the western end of the\\xc2\\xa0Victoria Falls. The Victoria Falls are the biggest waterfalls in Africa, discovered in 1855 by the explorer David Livingstone, According to the 2012 Population Census, the town had a population of 33,060.\\xc2\\xa0Victoria Falls Airport\\xc2\\xa0is located 18\\xc2\\xa0km south of the town and has international service to South Africa\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Namibia for the many tourists.\\r\\nThe settlement began in 1901 when the possibility of using the waterfall for\\xc2\\xa0hydro-electric\\xc2\\xa0power was explored, and was expanded when tourists on the railway from the south reached the town. The\\xc2\\xa0Victoria Falls Bridge\\xc2\\xa0was opened in April 1905, connecting Zimbabwe to what is now\\xc2\\xa0Zambia. It became the principal tourism centre for the Falls, experiencing economic booms from the 1930s on. Mari and Rein found the Victoria Falls more impressive than Niagara Falls. We got a very close view of the incredible power of nature, located somewhat in a jungle environment and in the central part of Africa, a terra incognito.\\r\\nMari and Rein spent a night at the famous Victoria Falls Hotel, which was always, and still is, the place to have tea on the terrace, British style, like some 100 years ago.\\r\\nNamibia is a country in\\xc2\\xa0southern Africa\\xc2\\xa0whose western border is the beautiful\\xc2\\xa0Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with\\xc2\\xa0Zambia\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Angola\\xc2\\xa0to the north,\\xc2\\xa0Botswana\\xc2\\xa0to the east and\\xc2\\xa0South Africa\\xc2\\xa0to the south and east. Such  Quadripoints are exceptional (at approximately Livingstone). Although it does not border\\xc2\\xa0Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River\\xc2\\xa0separates it from that country. \\r\\nNamibia has a population of 2.1\\xc2\\xa0million people and a stable\\xc2\\xa0multi-party\\xc2\\xa0parliamentary democracy. Windhoek (pop. 326,000), the capital, is in the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central highlands. Namibia itself is primarily a large desert or semi-desert plateau.\\r\\nIn the late 19th century during European colonization, the\\xc2\\xa0German Empire\\xc2\\xa0established rule over most of the territory as a protectorate in 1884. In 1915, South African forces defeated the German military. Germany lost the War in 1945. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990.\\r\\nSome Nazis, who escaped Europe, after 1945, came to Windhoek, to Swakop and other towns. In Swakop, men march periodically, in replicas of Nazi uniforms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What we can see in Namibia is that many German people are still in control of big business. Apartheid was even worse here than in South Africa. My friend, a \\xe2\\x80\\x98colored\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Namibian, who fought for the independence of his own country and of Angola, drove me to an outrageous slum which seems to host a substantial amount of the capital\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population, with mostly no access to basic sanitation or electricity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\nUntil Zimbabwe\\'s political problems surfaced with Mugabe, it was the place to stay to see the water falls. Whilst the past few years saw troubled times for the Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls Town was one of the few areas that managed to retain a semblance of a tourism industry. Recently the town has begun to come to life again with the old hotel receiving refurbishments. We were particularly fascinated by the many warthogs most of them were loose in\\xc2\\xa0front\\xc2\\xa0of the Hotel\\xc2\\xa0eating\\xc2\\xa0the\\xc2\\xa0lawn and keeping it neat. They were not interested in the people watching them.\\r\\nIn general white communities in African countries suffered a variety of fates in the post-colonial period. In many countries (e.g.\\xc2\\xa0Kenya, Namibia and\\xc2\\xa0Botswana) the white communities survived and eventually actually grew in number. In two particular cases,\\xc2\\xa0Algeria\\xc2\\xa0and Zimbabwe, the previously large European communities have shrunk. In both these last cases, the white communities had put up a fight against decolonisation and many white people found it difficult to adjust to the realities of the world they found themselves in after independence. Failure of white minorities to come to terms with the Black majority was to the mutual disadantage of both parties. For example, the remaining expatriate white farmers and hoteliers from Zimbabwe have done much to revive agriculture and develop tourism in Zambia, but have not made up the enormous decline.\\r\\nFrom Livingstone the Rovos Tourist train went through Zimbabwe to Bulowayo and thence to a wildlife Safari Lodge on the border with Botswana.\\r\\nJuly 27 Bulawayo is the second-largest city in Zimbabwe after the capital Harare, with, as of the 2012 census, a population of 655,000. Before the collapse of Zimbabwe\\'s rail infrastructure, Bulawayo was an important transport hub providing rail links between Botswana, South Africa and Zambia, and promoting the city\\'s development as a major industrial centre. The city still contains much of what remains of Zimbabwe\\'s heavy industry and food processing capability. Today Bulawayo is one of the country\\'s most attractive cities, with a pleasing mixture of Victorian and modern architecture, which gives it a unique character.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\nJuly 28 We passed through Gabarone the capital of Botswana, the capital and largest city of\\xc2\\xa0Botswana\\xc2\\xa0with a population of 232,000. From the train window it looked to have very modern buildings.\\xc2\\xa0Because the city had no tribal affiliation and was close to fresh water, the city was\\xc2\\xa0planned\\xc2\\xa0to be the capital in the mid-1960s when the Bechuanaland Protectorate\\xc2\\xa0became an independent nation. Gaberones, derived from Gaborone\\'s Village, was named after Chief Gaborone of the BaTlokwa,\\xc2\\xa0whose home village, now called\\xc2\\xa0Tlokweng, was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters. The nickname, \"GC\", comes from the name \"Government Camp\".\\xc2\\xa0In 1890,\\xc2\\xa0Cecil John Rhodes\\xc2\\xa0picked Gaberones to house a colonial fort. The city changed its name from Gaberones to Gaborone in 1969.\\r\\nBotswana, a landlocked country in Southern Africa, has a landscape defined by the Kalahari Desert and the Okavango Delta, which becomes a lush animal habitat during the seasonal floods. The massive Central Kalahari Game Reserve, with its fossilized river valleys and undulating grasslands, is home to numerous animals including giraffes, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs.\\r\\nFormerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name at independence in 1966. More than four decades of uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and significant capital investment have created one of the most stable economies in Africa. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party has won every election since independence. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining, dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due to the country\\'s conservation practices and extensive nature preserves. Botswana has one of the world\\'s highest known rates of HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa\\'s most progressive and comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.\\r\\nIts road network stretches for nearly 7,000 km, the government\\'s credit rating is the highest on the continent and per capita income has risen 13-fold to $7,000 (R96,000) thanks to growth averaging 8.2 percent a year, according to the World Bank.\\r\\nJuly 28 - 30The Tau Game and Safari Lodge was in the easternmost corner of Botswana, accessible by train. The Lodge was a small, luxurious and a relaxing retreat close to the Limpopo River. We had our own cabin. There was very good restaurant in the Lodge. In the Madikwe Game Reserve, our refined thatch-roofed chalets offered terraces with views of a watering hole. Throughout the day and especially in the evening a parade of animals came to the watering hole for a drink. They had free Wi-Fi and open-air showers, as well as mini-bars, ceiling fans and canopy beds with mosquito nets. It was easy to forget that we were in the middle of nowhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were taken to safaris on the backs of elephants and explored via Jeep the habitats of the African big five:\\xc2\\xa0elephants,\\xc2\\xa0lions,\\xc2\\xa0Cape buffalo,\\xc2\\xa0rhinoceroses, and\\xc2\\xa0leopards. (The big five are known to be some of the most dangerous and aggressive animals in Africa). We also saw giraffes, Buffalo, Lynx, Cougar, Gazelle, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuly 31 Pretoria (Tshwane), population 692,000, in the Gauteng Province, is the administrative capital of South Africa (pop. 52.98\\xc2\\xa0million). Known as \"Jacaranda City\" for its thousands of jacaranda trees, the city is also known for its universities and government buildings . The semicircular Union Buildings encompass the president\\'s offices and hosted Nelson Mandela\\'s inauguration. Nearby is the massive Voortrekker Monument, honoring 19th-century Afrikaans settlers from the Cape Colony. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is one of the country\\'s three\\xc2\\xa0capital cities, serving as the seat of the executive branch of government (Cape Town\\xc2\\xa0is the\\xc2\\xa0legislative\\xc2\\xa0capital and\\xc2\\xa0Bloemfontein\\xc2\\xa0the\\xc2\\xa0judicial\\xc2\\xa0capital). Statistics\\xc2\\xa0South Africa\\xc2\\xa0asks\\xc2\\xa0people\\xc2\\xa0to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population\\xc2\\xa0groups. The 2011 census figures for these categories were\\xc2\\xa0Black African\\xc2\\xa0at 76.4%,\\xc2\\xa0White\\xc2\\xa0at 9.1%, Coloured at 8.9%, Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%. The GDP for the country is 6,617.91 USD.\\xc2\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nAug. 1 Kimberley. Although a considerable degree of urban segregation already existed, one of the most significant impacts of\\xc2\\xa0Apartheid\\xc2\\xa0on the city of Kimberley was the implementation of the\\xc2\\xa0Group Areas Act. Communities were divided according to\\xc2\\xa0legislated\\xc2\\xa0racial categories, namely European (White), Native (Black), Coloured and Indian, and were legally separated by the\\xc2\\xa0Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. Individual families could be split up to three ways, based on such notorious measures as the \\'pencil test\\'. \\xc2\\xa0In the pencil test, a\\xc2\\xa0pencil\\xc2\\xa0was pushed through the person\\'s hair. How easily it comes out determined whether the person had \"passed\" or \"failed\" the test. This test was used to determine racial identity in\\xc2\\xa0South Africa\\xc2\\xa0during the\\xc2\\xa0apartheid\\xc2\\xa0era, which\\xc2\\xa0ended in 1994.\\r\\nTwo finds led to the first diamond rush in 1869 to the banks of the Orange River. A second far greater find was made in 1870 on the gravel banks of the Vaal River near Barkly West (35km north-west of present day Kimberley). At the height of the rush to these river diggings, diamonds were found in the mud brick walls of the farmhouse of Bultfontein (Hilly fountain) owned by Cornelius du Plooy. The house was dismantled and the site is now called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cColossal or Big Hole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a famous international tourist site.\\r\\nIt is here that the world famous Cecil Rhodes became a billionaire. One of Rhodes\\'s primary motivators in politics and business was his professed belief that the\\xc2\\xa0English-speaking peoples\\xc2\\xa0were destined to greatness as, to quote his\\xc2\\xa0will, \"the first race in the world\".\\xc2\\xa0Under the reasoning that \"the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race\",\\xc2\\xa0he advocated vigorous\\xc2\\xa0settler colonialism\\xc2\\xa0and ultimately a reformation of the\\xc2\\xa0British Empire\\xc2\\xa0so that each component would be self-governing and\\xc2\\xa0represented in a single parliament\\xc2\\xa0in London.\\r\\nAug. 2 Cape Town. Cape Town (pop. 3,740,000) is a port city on South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s southwest coast, on a peninsula beneath the imposing Table Mountain. Slowly rotating cable cars climb to the mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flat top, from which there are sweeping views of the city, the busy harbor and boats heading for Robben Island, the notorious prison that once held Nelson Mandela, which is now a living museum.\\r\\nIn early 1990s, Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and on April 27 th1994, he became the first Black President of the country. Today, South Africa is one of the most democratic countries in Africa and although it still struggles under the yoke of inequality, cities like Cape Town have made major strides in ensuring equality for all.\\r\\nAfrikaans\\xc2\\xa0is a Low Franconian Germanic language descended from Dutch and spoken mainly in South Africa and Namibia. Boer, (Dutch: \\xe2\\x80\\x9chusbandman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfarmer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a South African of Dutch, German, or Huguenot descent, especially one of the early settlers of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. Today, descendants of the Boers are commonly referred to as\\xc2\\xa0Afrikaners.\\r\\nThe Boers, then known as Afrikaners, were the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of southern Africa. Britain took possession of the Dutch Cape colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, sparking resistance from the independence-minded Boers, who resented the Anglicization of South Africa and Britain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anti-slavery policies. In 1833, the Boers began an exodus into African tribal territory, where they founded the republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The two new republics lived peaceably with their British neighbors until 1867, when the discovery of diamonds and gold in the region made conflict between the Boer states and Britain inevitable.\\r\\nSubsequently the British militarily annexed the Transvaal, but, at the battle of Majuba Hill in 1881 the Boers defeated the British and won back most of their independence. The discovery of gold in the Transvaal brought not only wealth but an influx of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuitlanders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (foreigners) many of them British subjects, who by 1895 greatly outnumbered the Boers. The uitlanders were extortionately taxed, as President Kruger of the Transvaal, determined to maintain Boer supremacy, refused to give them the vote.\\r\\nBy the end of 1901 almost the whole of the Cape Colony was under martial law. The British army in South Africa had the strength of close to a quarter of a million soldiers; the Boers at no time had more than 30,000 men under arms; but the British had been always non-strategically scattered among many sites and over lines of communication of several thousand miles.\\r\\nIn the end, given the great resources and unlimited resolution, it was believed that British were bound to succeed. At a ruinous cost, the South African countrysides were becoming like the British colonies again. At the cost of turning them into irreconcilables, not willing persons, whom the British had intended to transform into British citizens, again. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome Letters of that time:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Pernilla & Co. (In Sweden):\\r\\nMari\\'s cancer has masdecised (entered the blood stream). New cancers were discovered in her lymph nodes leading to her lungs and once again in the liver. The Oncologists don\\'t have any way of counter-acting cancer that has entered the blood stream and have to counter-act the best they know how, wherever it strikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMari started Chemo Therapy yesterday AM and will take 6 Chemo pills twice a day, plus anti-nausea pills and several others that help the Chemo treatment to do its job. For the lymph node I am giving her, every AM, an intravenous shot of medicine into her tummy. This seems to have helped her to feel less \"heavy in her chest\", but causes her to hyper-ventilate if she has to move around and strain herself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMike & Janis & Jaak and Jenny & Ontang  (In Ottawa and Toronto):\\r\\nI have been allowing Jenny to keep you up to date. It seems to help her and she wants to do it.Unless you want me to write to you sooner, I will send updates only when things may not seem quite clear to Jenny. She didn\\'t come to the last Clinic session on Jan. 28, that was a bit of an eye-opener to me personally. The doctors are reaching the limits of their knowledge and cannot promise anything. They seem to be in experimental mode.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn Feb. 18 we went to see Dr. Liu again for a progress report. On Feb 22 we go to \"Chemo Day Care\" and it is on that day that the first 21 days of Chemo via tablets at home, ends. I would guess that they will start giving her \"gunk\" intravenously. On Feb. 25 MOM goes to a Thrombosis Clinic at Toronto General to have her Lymph nodes (lung) checked. On Mar. 23 at TGH she will get a CT SCAN (again), and then will be subjected to Vascular Interventional Radiation later on the same day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMari laheb R\\xc3\\xb6ntgeni alla 7-dal jaanuaaril ja teatakse meile mis tuleb ette v\\xc3\\xb5tta.

Mari is very keen on going and it has motivated her to put up with all the chemicals and the mumbo-jumbo witch doctors. BANZAI!\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were some of the main issues regarding our trip to Indonesia that Ontang organized:\\r\\n- A wheel chair needs to be ready.\\r\\n-Cremation place (just in case.......). Ontang talked to his sister and she showed him the place.\\r\\n-There is no Hospital in Medan specializing in cancer. There are some big\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0and good hospitals in Siantar (one hour from Lake Toba) and some more in     Medan, plus there is an \"Internatinal Siloam Glen Eagle hospital\" owned and     operated by a Singapore company.\\r\\n\\r\\nOntang assured us about the accomodation:\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 * The cottage was beautiful, (good for Mari) and well organized.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 * Our units were close to each other.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 * Our accomodation costs around C$38 per night.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 * Including breakfast,\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 * Ontang chose these cottages because he knows the owner and she  \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 gave us good discount and she knows about Western food. She \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 lives in Tuktuk and is German.\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 * Ontang booked the cottage for a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing to be impressed about us. Mari as a psychologist has schooled me well and our put-on is nothing more but psyching ourselves up to face the inevitable --- But, first, we will take a trip to Parapat/Lake Toba/Northern Sumatra to see our daughter have her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBatak Marriage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Ontang at the village he was born in. Mari really believed in this goal and so did I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toba Batak Chiefs, starting in Dutch Colonial times, knew that Westerners were fearful of the stories of Batak cannibalism. They made frequent use of such concocted stories to scare visiting foreigners and to so defend the interests of their home territory. These stories are still told, but their source has long been forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Batak Toba are generally perceived as confident, outspoken and willing to question authority, expressing differences, in order to resolve them through discussion. The Batak Toba are also known throughout Indonesia as capable musicians, and the yearly Opera Batak | Karnaval Kemerdekaan Pesona Danau Toba demonstrates the active local musical tradition that is available on UTube. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany Batak tribes are located all over Sumatra, Indonesia. But the centre of Toba Batak culture is considered to be the large isthmus/Samosir Island, about the size of Singapore, but with only120,000 inhabitants. It is actually a large\\xc2\\xa0volcanic\\xc2\\xa0island in\\xc2\\xa0the middle of Lake Toba. Lake Toba was the site of a massive supervolcanic eruption that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, a climate-changing event for the whole world. It was the largest known explosive eruption on\\xc2\\xa0Earth\\xc2\\xa0in the last 25 million years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island is the centre of Batak\\xc2\\xa0culture and many of the Toba Batak traditional houses (rumah adat) remain on the island. The large steeply-pitched saddle back roof dominates the structure. The roofs are traditionally thatched, and with no internal roof trusses and they provide a large internal space. Sharply projected triangular eaves and gables overlap all around the substructure. The front gable extends further than the rear gable and is finely carved and painted with motifs of suns, starts, cockerels, and geometric motifs in red, white, and black. The rear gable remains plain.  They are beautiful magnificent structures. \\r\\n\\r\\nParapat, in Ajibata Bay, was the port for the ferry access to Tuktuk, on Samosir Island. This was the location of the cottage that Mari and Rein stayed at.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most fundamental value in Toba Batak culture is the following of adat, a term used all over Indonesia. In the broadest sense, adat refers to everything in nature that is following its own particular life course.  Most marriages used to be arranged, but those who were about to get married often had sorne say in the choice of a spouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toba Batak generally interpreted the Christian Church as a saha/an organisation in which divine power was distributed. Toba Batak language remained the language used in daily conversation and in church. Christianity has been incorporated and appropriated into the Toba cosmos. \\xc2\\xa0Indonesia\\'s 45 million Christians constitute about 20% of the country\\'s population (249.9 million).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1862 German Lutheran missionaries arrived in the Lake Toba district. European confessional formulae followed translation of Martin Luther\\'s Small Catechism, explaining the commandments in relation to Toba culture and arranging the Ten Commandments according to a Reformed tradition that emphasised what God forbids. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toba Batak realised that schooling could lead to employment by the missionaries or in the colonial administration. The eagerness with which the Toba wanted schooling for their children meant that by the end of the 19th century they had established a strong tradition of education.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local Toba Batak Chiefs, starting in Dutch Colonial times, knew that Westerners were fearful of the stories of Batak cannibalism. They made frequent use of such concocted stories to scare visiting foreigners and to so defend the interests of their home territory.

The eagerness with which the Toba wanted schooling for their children meant that by the end of the 19th century they had established a strong tradition of education. \\r\\n\\r\\nJune 15 - 17 Mari/Jenny/Rein flew from Toronto \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Narita, Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Singapore \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Crown Plaza Hotel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then via \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilk Air\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Medan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and by 5 hour automobile drive to Parapat on the shore of Lake Toba \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Then by Ferry to Tuktuk village \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to our Cottage. A period of nearly 48 hours had passed, during which Mari had sat immobile or on her wheel chair. She was not able to be too mobile. Mari was a very brave woman, demonstrating that she wanted to be present for the marriages of both her children.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 26-th of June, 2009 Ontang and Jennifer-Mai Charlotte wedding was held Toba Batak style in an open air covered structure, in Parapat on the mainland. \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 1000 members of the local Batak community, all related in some way to Ontang Sirait, participated in the dancing and welcoming of the new bride into the family. Mari participated, until she tired in the middle of the dancing, and had to be put into bed. A totally unfamiliar Batak relative of Ontang, at a nearby house, turned her bed over to Mari, until the end of the celebrations. This was a tremendous act of kindness.\\r\\n\\r\\n                              ---------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREIN:\\r\\n \\r\\nLadies and gentlemen, a wedding is a great day for many reasons. It is, of course, a holy occasion, where two people commit themselves to become one, forever. It is also one of the most important milestones in our lives, one that we will always remember. \\r\\n\\r\\n(NOTE: The ceremony that follows is meant as an illustration of ancient Estonian cultural practices and should not be viewed as idol worship.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThis beautiful lady, next to me, has been married to me for 46 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93- that is, in 2 weeks on August 31, 2009.\\r\\n \\r\\nOntang, before we proceed, let me tell you a secret. It will always be critical for you to remember your wedding anniversary date and the date of her birthday and all the other anniversaries that are important to Jenny! \\r\\n \\r\\nThe best way to learn to do this, as I found out , was to forget any one of them, the first time --- I guarantee that you will never forget any one of them again --- never --- never --- forever!\\r\\n \\r\\nA wedding day is also a party. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a celebration. It is an opportunity to meet all the people who are and will be important in your lives, and to say to them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we love you and are indeed fortunate to have you as our friends.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo our new Indonesian friends, who will be introduced to us later, I say that any friend of Ontang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, will be also loved by us.\\r\\n \\r\\nKAMI BERJANJI HARI INI KEPADA ANDA SEMUANYA UNTUK MENGENAL ANDA LEBIH DEKAT DAN KITA SALING MENGASIHI.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMARI:\\r\\n \\r\\nI would like to recognize some people who are here today and who have sent us and Jenny and Ontang their best wishes.\\r\\n \\r\\n         Jacob, Michael and Janis \\r\\n         Calvin and Carla Spafford\\r\\n         Lisa and Linda Stockley\\r\\n         Carl, Elizabeth, Jeff Hammacher and Emi Nakazawa\\r\\n         Jaan and Anne Kiis\\r\\n         Tonis and Kadri Laar\\r\\n \\r\\nFrom afar we have received greetings from members of our extended family:\\r\\n         Estonia:\\r\\n                  Reet and Mare Sarap\\r\\n                  Tonu and Milvi Peterson\\r\\n         Sweden:\\r\\n                  Leif and Mari-Ann Johansson\\r\\n                  Saga, Rod and Pernilla Lopez/Johansson\\r\\n                  Gosta and Aime Jonsson\\r\\n         Key West, Florida:\\r\\n                  Walter and Joanna Schmida\\r\\n         Brussels, Belgium:\\r\\n                  Maria, Mark, Peder and Bergit Christensen\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nREIN:\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Wedding Celebration is also an opportunity to recall things about the couple, that they may not always want to reveal in public. Since we are among our extended family, I think it is appropriate to reveal some of these truths. Remember, Jenny and Ontang, you are a wonderful couple. Regardless of our revelations, I am a very proud to be a father to the both you.\\r\\n \\r\\nMARI:\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll try to make sure that Rein behaves himself. Ontang is a delightful young man whom we are now proud to call a member of the Peterson Clan. But, I am sure, that his Best man (Taurus Tobing) will give us some details on Ontang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wild bachelor life before meeting Jenny.\\r\\n \\r\\nREIN:\\r\\n\\r\\nOntang, as a proper Batak gentleman, asked me out for supper. He was paying. After some small talk, he said to me, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir, I would like to marry your daughter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is always a shock to most fathers, who are usually in denial, that some day their little girl will become some man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loving wife. I paused and thought this proposal out carefully. Very carefully.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt had always been my practice, to be an overly protective father, who called any seemingly serious suitors of Jenny as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGORILLAS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This scared away several of them. I had called Ontang also a Gorilla in front of Jenny. But she had warned Ontang about this. And here he was, an obviously love-struck GORILLA, bravely sitting right in front of me, asking for my daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand. \\r\\n \\r\\nHow do you say no to a love-sick GORILLA? Impossible! Besides he seemed like a reasonable chap. Called me \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSIR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. So I said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and we gave each other a hug.\\r\\n \\r\\nMARI:\\r\\n \\r\\nJenny, like Ontang is also a brave and committed person. My first recollection of Jennifer (age 4 or 5) is her jumping off the 10 meter diving platform, at the Toronro Olympium Pool, feet first into the water --- 30 feet below. Before launching herself, she flapped her little hands at her sides (an obvious nervous gesture), but like the song about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe unsinkable Molly Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, she swam the length of the entire pool, constantly looking ahead to see how much further she had to go.\\r\\n \\r\\nREIN:\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen I first saw this happening, I jumped up, climbed over the seat barriers and ran for the diving tower. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSPLASH!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I was too late. I ran beside the pool encouraging her to keep swimming a distance she had never swum before \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the full length of an Olympic Pool. Her coach came running up beside me and shouting \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet her go, she may not have much style, but she is unsinkable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It occurred to me then that I was a very poor swimmer and an eminently sinkable liability. So I left Jenny and her coach to deal with Neptune.\\r\\n \\r\\nMARI:\\r\\n \\r\\nMy next recollection is that when Jenny got mad at her brother, she would shout at him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichael, Michael, Daniel, Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and stamp her little foot. Michael loved his sister dearly as she did him. When we lived in Cape Breton the 9 year old would carry the 2 year old on his back to the park at the end of the street, to play on the swings. There were no other 2 year olds close to our house. It reminded me of the story about the young boy who said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is not heavy she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my sister!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n \\r\\nREIN:\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen Jenny was young, I often bought her t-shirts saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpoiled Rotten\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when I was away from home on business trips. We started to call her: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD. D. D. S. R. P. B-B.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Which stands for: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDaddy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s darling daughter, spoiled rotten, princess boom-boom! Which she is still today. Take notice Ontang!\\r\\n \\r\\nNow this reminds me about how she became to be called Jennifer Mai Charlotte Peterson. We waited for Michael, our first born, for 7 years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 since we both were PhD students completing our degrees. We discussed often as to what we should call our children in the future. Mari said that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter to her whether a girl or boy was born first. She would love each of them equally. When the due date for our first child approached on May 11, 1972 we agreed that if a boy was born first, he would be called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichael Daniel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (after his grandfather Daniel), and so he was. To commemorate our decision to love each child equally, we named our second child \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJennifer Mai\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mai stands for the month of May in Estonian). Mai will remind each of us that if she had been born first in May, that would have been alright with us too. \\r\\n \\r\\nNow how come she became to be called Charlotte, you may ask, where did that name come from? Well it is a closely guarded family secret. You will have to ask Jenny. Just a hint, it had something to do with Charlottetown, P.E.I. Our lips are sealed!\\r\\n \\r\\nMARI:\\r\\n \\r\\nI have always remembered a song by The Andrews Sisters called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, My Darling Daugther\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The lyrics of which I still agree with\\r\\nand, in closing, recommend to you, dear newly married, Jenny from your MOM:\\r\\n       \\r\\nMother, may I go out dancing?\\r\\nYes, my darling daughter\\r\\nMother may I try romancing?\\r\\nYes my darling daughter\\r\\nWhat if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a moon, momma darling, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shining on the water\\r\\nMother, must I keep on dancing?\\r\\nYes, my darling daughter\\r\\nWhat if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll propose, mama darling, when the night is growing shorter?\\r\\nMother, what should be my answer?\\r\\nYes, my darling daughter\\r\\n \\r\\nMother, will it be exciting?\\r\\nMother, do I look inviting?\\r\\nWhat if he holds me tight and my knees just turn to water\\r\\nMama, what should I do?\\r\\nWhat if there is a moon, my momma darling, and its shining on the water\\r\\nMother, must I keep on dancing?\\r\\nYes, my darling daughter\\r\\nWhat if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll propose, my mama darling, when the night is growing shorter?\\r\\nMother, what do you think should be my answer?\\r\\nYes, my darling daugther\\r\\n \\r\\nOh mama darling, what if he holds my hand and then says, \\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome just a little closer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nMother dear, what should be my answer?\\r\\nOh yes, my darling daughter\\r\\n\\r\\n                              ------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n2010  \\r\\n\\r\\nPort-au-Prince,\\xc2\\xa0Haiti, region\\'sworst\\xc2\\xa0earthquake\\xc2\\xa0in 200 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter Olympics\\xc2\\xa0opens in Vancouver.
